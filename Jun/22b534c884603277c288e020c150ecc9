This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Yorkshire Sculpture Park. It is Europe’s leading international centre for modern and contemporary sculpture, situated in the 500-acre, 18th-century Bretton Hall estate near Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It is the only place to see Barbara Hepworth’s The Family of Man in its entirety, alongside a significant collection of sculpture including works by Elisabeth Frink, Henry Moore, Giuseppe Penone and Sean Scully. YSP also mounts a year-round temporary exhibitions programme, presenting the world’s leading artists across six galleries and the open air. You can see art from the collection on Art UK here. Find out more on the Yorkshire Sculpture Park website here.
