Amid the complaints about airlines and travel operators not reimbursing readers for cancelled trips, there has been a noticeable number of reports of refunds being made. GG, from Malvern, wrote this week to praise Jet2, which has just refunded his “very expensive” flight to Turkey that should have left in May. Other readers have reported being similarly impressed by Jet2. Elsewhere, some – but not all – readers have reported receiving refunds from British Airways. Ryanair, easyJet and KLM, and online agents such as Opodo, continue to receive criticism for failing to process refunds. The Civil Aviation Authority has warned airlines over this matter. It seems that those who keep asking for refunds are starting to get them. Readers report a mixed picture at Eurostar, with some receiving their money back and others not. If you have flights or rail trips booked in the coming weeks, the advice is to hold your nerve and see how things develop. At the time of writing the government is still advising against all but essential travel, but more flights are resuming. Kettler won praise after it replaced a reader’s three-year-old garden furniture that had started to rust. It had a five-year guarantee. “They have replaced the furniture with a new bench and two chairs, provided free cushions, and took the old furniture away – excellent after-sales service,” he says.
