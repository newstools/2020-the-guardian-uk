Congratulations on a brilliant edition of Weekend magazine (13 June). You were brave to let loose graduating students from art schools to contribute to this special edition, but it worked. I was so absorbed for so long that I didn’t get my permitted morning walk. At 80, I occasionally find I’m out of touch with the young, but this emphasised how we’re all in this together, and their innovation, flair and kindness made my day. Jude McGowan London • Removing statues is not lying about history, as Boris Johnson claims (Boris Johnson ‘stoking fear and division’ ahead of BLM protests, 12 June). Erecting statues celebrating people who have profited from slavery or other indefensible aspects of our imperial past is lying about history – pretending that these people should be revered, rather than despised. Cherry Weston Wolverhampton • On the plus side, the speed with which protective shielding for statues was commissioned, designed, produced, delivered and installed shows what great British manufacturing can still achieve with the right incentive. Inspiring stuff. Shame about the PPE for the heroes of the battle against Covid-19. Robert Carlisle Oxford • What an amazing photo (BLM supporter speaks out after carrying counter-protester to safety, 14 June) of the Black Lives Matter supporter Patrick Hutchinson carrying an injured counter-protester to safety. Please could someone sculpt that image and place it on a plinth for us all to admire and look up to? Jo Burden Marlow, Buckinghamshire • “Coy elm” is not an anagram of “lovely” (Corrections and clarifications, 14 June), but it is of “comely”, which is what I entered into the quick crossword on 12 June.
