It is with considerable sadness and very real concern that I hear you are closing Guardian Soulmates after nearly 16 years of the dating website (Guardian Soulmates is coming to an end). Over the years, Soulmates has given many of us an additional dimension to our social lives, as well as, for the lucky ones, the fulfilment and happiness of finding a new partner. Essentially, there is no other comparable site that gives reliable access to others that, with a degree of certainty, given that they are probably Guardian readers, have similar values to oneself. I presume the decision has been taken on financial grounds. As a Guardian partner of a certain generation, I can say that, even at this late stage, if there is any scope to reconsider the decision, be assured that there would be many very grateful Soulmates.Les YoungLichfield, Staffordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
