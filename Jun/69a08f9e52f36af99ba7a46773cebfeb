Philippe Coutinho is “definitely” interested in a return to the Premier League at some point, according to the Brazilian’s agent, Kia Joorabchian. The 27-year-old left Liverpool in a £142m move to Barcelona in January 2018 but failed to live up to expectations at Camp Nou and joined Bayern Munich on a season-long loan last summer. The midfielder’s performances have been encouraging but the Bundesliga champions have reportedly decided against taking up the option to buy. Coutinho has been linked with Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham and Joorabchian said his client is very interested in a return to England. “We’re still waiting until the season finishes before we start talking about anything in terms of transfers,” he told Talksport. “I’ve always said he loves to play in the Premier League. He enjoyed his time very much and if the opportunity arises to come back to the Premier League, whether it be this year or in the future, he’s definitely looking at that.”
