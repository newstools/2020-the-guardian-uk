Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty on Italian football’s return but Juventus still reached the Coppa Italia final despite being held by 10-man Milan in Turin. The goalless draw proved enough for Juve to progress on away goals courtesy of a stoppage-time Ronaldo penalty in a 1-1 draw at the San Siro almost four months ago. The Portugal forward hit the post from the spot 16 minutes into the game but the match turned in the home side’s favour again six seconds later when the Croatian striker Ante Rebic caught Danilo with a chest-high studs-showing challenge, for which he was sent off. There was little in the way of goalmouth action, although Milan stepped up their efforts as the game progressed without creating many openings. History was made as Milan brought on five substitutes and Juventus four in new rules designed to help squads deal with the fixture demands following the coronavirus suspension. Juve will play either Napoli or Internazionale in the final with the Naples side 1-0 up going into their home leg. In Spain Granada beat Getafe 2-1 courtesy of Carlos Fernández’s 79th-minute goal before Valencia were denied by a Levante equaliser in the eighth minute of injury time in a dramatic finale at the Mestalla. Rodrigo’s 89th-minute goal appeared to have clinched victory for the home team before Fernández’s late strike for Levante, who had Roger Martí sent off after 74 minutes. Elsewhere Dani Olmo hit an early double as RB Leipzig consolidated third place in the Bundesliga with a 2-0 win at Hoffenheim.
