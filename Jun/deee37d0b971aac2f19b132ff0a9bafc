Center Parcs is to reopen its UK and Irish holiday “villages” on 13 July – but its pools and spas will stay closed. The company, which shut its five UK centres on 20 March ahead of the coronavirus lockdown, said it would allow visitors to cancel new and existing bookings up to six days before arrival and receive a full refund, as it recognised some would want to reschedule because of changes to its facilities. As well as the closure of pools and spas, Center Parcs said there would be a reduced number of holidaymakers at each venue, changes to some activities to ensure physical distancing in line with government guidelines, extra cleaning and a new takeaway service. Martin Dalby, the chief executive, said: “We know how disappointing it will be for some families that the subtropical swimming paradise isn’t open during their break. We have been planning the changes needed to maintain social distancing and we look forward to reopening these facilities as soon as we are able. However, we know that so many families have been looking forward to their breaks and we are so pleased to be open for the summer.” The company said it was beginning to bring back its 8,500 employees from furlough and train them in new ways of working and safety procedures ahead of reopening. Center Parcs will reopen more than a week after hospitality venues were given the green light to get back to business. Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to open in England from 4 July. Campsites will be given guidance on shared areas such as shower, toilet and washing-up facilities. British businesses are expected to enjoy a boom in trade from staycations over the remains of the summer, as fears about flying abroad as well as quarantine rules put a dampener on overseas trips.
