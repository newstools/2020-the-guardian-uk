Odion Ighalo is staying with Manchester United after the club agreed a loan extension with Shanghai Shenhua until 31 January 2021. The former Watford striker made a surprise deadline-day switch from the Chinese Super League side in January but the 30-year-old quickly made an impression at Old Trafford. Ighalo scored four goals in eight appearances for the club he supported since childhood, only for the coronavirus suspension in England to take the season well beyond the loan deal’s expiry date of 31 May. It is understood the extension does not include an option to buy the striker. Ole Gunnar Solskjær had indicated his desire to keep Ighalo. “Odion has done really well – we need those qualities for next season so let’s see,” he said in March.
