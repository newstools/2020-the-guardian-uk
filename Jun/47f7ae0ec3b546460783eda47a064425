This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Amgueddfeydd Sir Gâr/Carmarthenshire Museums, in south-west Wales. The collections span 50,000 years of history and reflect the county’s varied past. The art collection is a good mix of local and Welsh subjects and artists, and contains some surprises.
