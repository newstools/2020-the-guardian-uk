This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Victoria and Albert Museum. The V&A is a leading museum of art design and performance established in 1852 to make works of art available to all and to inspire British designers and manufacturers. Today, its collections span more than 5,000 years of human ingenuity. See pieces from the V&A on Art UK here and find out more about the V&A here.
