Leroy Sané is heading for the Manchester City exit after Pep Guardiola said the winger had turned down a new contract. The 24-year-old Germany international has 12 months left on his deal and has been heavily linked with Bayern Munich, with Guardiola saying on Friday Sané will be able to leave if the club can find a buyer. “Leroy has rejected to extend his contract,” the manager said. “Everyone knows. If at the end of the season two clubs agree he can leave, if not he will leave at the end of his contract. The club offered two or three times and he rejected it.” Sané has not played for City since he suffered a knee ligament injury in the Community Shield victory over Liverpool last August. He returned to the substitutes’ bench against Arsenal on Wednesday, but was not among the five players brought on by Guardiola, increasing speculation over his future. Guardiola added that David Silva and Claudio Bravo would stay with the club until the end of the extended season, having initially been due to leave at the end of June.
