Manchester City’s game against Liverpool next Thursday will go ahead at the Etihad Stadium even if the title remains up for grabs. The decision was made by Manchester council’s safety advisory group, which said it had no objections to the match being played as planned. The SAG, which includes representatives from the council, emergency services, environmental health and supporters’ groups, could have asked for the game to be moved to a neutral venue. Liverpool will win the Premier League before then if City fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday. If City win, the next opportunity for Liverpool to secure the title will be at the Etihad Stadium. Jürgen Klopp had said he wanted the match to be played there.
