Home is where the art is. That has been the experience for a lot us in the last few months. Art shops have enjoyed a surge in demand. Online classes are booming. And more people are painting, crocheting, sewing, sculpting and drawing than they were a few months ago. If you are one of them, we want to see the fruits of your labours. It doesn’t matter whether you are a beginner, someone who has rekindled your creativity in the last few months or an experienced artist who has been producing work for years. We welcome all comers. You can send us your work and tell us about it by filling in the form below. It is encrypted so only the Guardian will see your responses. One of our journalists may be in touch for more information, so please leave your contact details. If you can’t see the form, click here. Read our terms of service here.
