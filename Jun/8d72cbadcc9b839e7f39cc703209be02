Australia’s trade minister says the sentencing to death in China of an Australian man for drug smuggling should not necessarily be linked to the ongoing friction between the countries. Cam Gilespie was arrested with more than 7.5kg of methamphetamine in his check-in luggage in 2013 while attempting to board an international flight from Baiyun airport in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. The Guangzhou intermediate people’s court announced his sentencing on Saturday. The court also ordered that all of Gilespie’s personal property be confiscated. “This is very distressing for Mr Gilespie and his loved ones, and our government will continue to provided consular assistance,” Simon Birmingham told the Sky News Sunday Agenda program. He said Gilespie still has a 10-day window to appeal the verdict. He said Australia condemns the death penalty in all circumstances across all countries. “This is a reminder to all Australians ... that Australian laws don’t apply overseas, that other countries have much harsher penalties, particularly in relation to matters such as drug trafficking,” the minister said. Asked whether he thought this incident was linked to the ongoing political row between China and Australia, the senator said: “We shouldn’t necessarily view it as such.” Australia’s relationship with China has suffered over its support for an independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 and trade retaliation, including tariffs on Australian barley.
