The New York City Marathon, which had been scheduled for 1 November, has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. New York Road Runners announced the cancellation of the world’s largest marathon on Wednesday after coordinating with the mayor’s office and deciding the race posed too many health and safety concerns for runners, volunteers and spectators. “Canceling this year’s TCS New York City Marathon is incredibly disappointing for everyone involved, but it was clearly the course we needed to follow from a health and safety perspective,” Michael Capiraso, president and CEO of New York Road Runners, said in a statement. “Marathon day and the many related events and activities during race week are part of the heart and soul of New York City and the global running community, and we look forward to coming together next year.” New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said he hoped to welcome the race back in 2021. “While the marathon is an iconic and beloved event in our city, I applaud New York Road Runners for putting the health and safety of both spectators and runners first,” he said in a statement. “We look forward to hosting the 50th running of the marathon in November of 2021.” Last year’s marathon included a world record 53,640 finishers. Entrants for the 2020 race will be offered a full refund of their entry fee or a guaranteed entry to either the 2021, 2022 or 2023 marathon. The 2021 New York City Marathon is scheduled for 7 November.
