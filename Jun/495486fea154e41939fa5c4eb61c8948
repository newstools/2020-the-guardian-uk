Frankie Dettori has ridden his 70th winner at Royal Ascot, exactly 30 years to the day after his first winner at the famous race-meeting. The veteran jockey delivered Fanny Logan with an unstoppable charge down the centre of the track to land Friday’s Hardwicke Stakes, adding to his wins in the Gold Cup and the Ribblesdale earlier this week. “Now I want 71!” was the typically competitive response from the Italian, when reminded that he had reached the landmark. “I was further back than I wanted, but they started racing really early and by the time I got to the furlong marker they were all dead. She showed a good turn of foot.” But Dettori could finish only second in the day’s biggest race, the Commonwealth Cup, in which he partnered the US raider Kimari. Golden Horde delivered an emphatic success for the enduring team of trainer Clive Cox and jockey Adam Kirby, seven years after they landed the Diamond Jubilee with this chestnut’s sire, Lethal Force. Kirby praised Golden Horde for having “a great natural cruising speed” and added: “There’s one man I cant thank enough and that’s Clive.” Cox said of their partnership: “We’ve enjoyed lots of good days here and this really takes the biscuit.” Golden Horde, who lives in the same box his father once occupied, may be seen next in the July Cup at Newmarket. He put daylight between him and Kimari in the closing stages, with Ventura Rebel a well held third at 50-1. Lope Y Fernandez was a disappointing favourite, but not so disappointing as Pierre Lapin, who had started the day as favourite but never got close to the front and was eased out of the race in the final furlong.
