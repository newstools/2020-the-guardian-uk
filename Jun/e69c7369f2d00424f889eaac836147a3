This take on the tequila sour is one of the most popular cocktails at our trattoria Gloria in Shoreditch, east London. The syrup mix makes enough for four serves, because it’s not really worth making in smaller quantities. It will keep in sealed jar in the fridge for a fair old while, assuming you don’t use it all up. Serves 1 65ml tequila75ml grapefruit juice 10ml (or 2 tsp) lemongrass syrup – stir a drop of lemongrass oil into 40ml standard gomme syrup 15ml fresh lime juice (from about ½ lime)Salt, to rim the glass (we use pink salt, for the look)1 grapefruit slice, to garnish Put all the liquids in a shaker. Rub the cut lime around half the rim of a tall glass and dip in salt to coat. Add ice to the shaker and shake for 10 seconds. Double-strain into the glass, add ice and garnish with a slice of fresh grapefruit. • Alberto Sinibaldi, beverage manager, Big Mamma Group
