I’m sure I’m not the only one who has observed the increased usage of the NHS label appended to the test-and-trace service (Letters, 5 June) now that it is attracting criticism. If it fails, it’s an NHS failure; if it works, it’s a success for private enterprise.Dr Martin J SchwarzOldham, Greater Manchester • You state that Serco wants to “cement the position” of the private sector in the NHS (NHS test-and-trace system ‘not fully operational until September’, 4 June).
