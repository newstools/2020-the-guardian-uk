One reliable lockdown pleasure has been Norah Jones’s performances “for anyone who wants to listen”. Unflashy and sensibly short, she plays piano requests, covers or demos, while streams of fans thank “Nojo” for being there for them. You’ll see a lot of the words “healing”, “calming” and “peace”. Less overtly jazzy than 2016’s Day Breaks, this set of new self-penned songs wraps country, soul and jazz in soft pillows of sound presided over by the Texan’s remarkable smoke-wreathed croon. It’s an astonishing instrument of control and comfort – and it makes the weary spikiness of her lyrics even more effective. The music is set to do-not-disturb, but Jones has found a nuanced, emotive way to discuss loss, lies, regret, indecision and depression, along with the value of protest and defiance. Yes, it’s blues in a lovely pastel colour, never pure desolation, but it’s clear that something – or someone – has got at Jones in the past four years. It may be a coincidence that this album aligns with the US electoral cycle, but lyrics as foggy and unresolved as “don’t look so sad, it’s not that bad/ Or is it? It might be today” have rarely seemed so apt.
