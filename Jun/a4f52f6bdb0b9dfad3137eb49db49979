Robert Lewandowski netted a second-half winner as holders Bayern Munich remained on course for a domestic double after beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 on Wednesday to reach the German Cup final for the third straight year. Frankfurt, who wore a special away kit promoting the Black Lives Matter movement, were poor in the first half conceding through Ivan Perisic, but found their rhythm in the second half with a goal from Danny Da Costa before Lewandowski’s winner proved decisive.

In the second half we did not do it well,” Bayern’s head coach, Hansi Flick, said. “But it was a Cup game and at the end it was a deserved qualification. It could have been an easier second half if we had done it better in the first.” Bayern will now play Bayer Leverkusen, who cruised past fourth-tier Saarbrücken 3-0 on Tuesday, in the final in Berlin on 4 July. Having all but secured the Bundesliga title and chasing a 20th German Cup crown, Bayern were unstoppable in the first half and an unmarked Perisic headed in a Thomas Müller cross for the lead in the 14th minute. They should have scored several more with Perisic, Kingsley Coman and Lewandowski repeatedly going close as the visitors were completely outclassed in the first half. Frankfurt, who beat Bayern in the 2018 final, came out transformed after the break and snatched an equaliser through the substitute Da Costa in the 69th minute. Yet Lewandowski scored the winner five minutes later with Bayern’s only real chance in the second half after confusion in the Frankfurt box and following a VAR review.
