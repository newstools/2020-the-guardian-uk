Living in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life. Perhaps this time away from normality will help us reflect on how we were living before and make new plans for the future: to discard some old habits and build some new ones. If you feel as if you have learned something about yourself over the last few weeks and hope to change your life, we want to hear from you. Maybe you want to spend more time in nature, pay more attention to your neighbours, reassess your relationship, change you job, be more creative, keep better contact with old friends, spend less money (or more), or worry less. Whatever is on your mind, we want to know. You can get in touch with us by filling in the encrypted form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information if you are happy to be contacted. If you canâ€™t see the form, click here.
