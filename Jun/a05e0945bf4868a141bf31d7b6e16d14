Michael Winterbottom is set to bring Boris Johnson’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic to television. The film-maker, whose credits include 24 Hour Party People and the Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon series The Trip, will co-write and direct a co-production between Fremantle, Passenger – which makes the anthology series True Detective – and Revolution Films. The Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman will act as a consultant to the programme makers. Shipman’s book All Out War also served as the basis for the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, in which Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings. Announcing the project, Passenger’s Richard Brown described the premise as “a story which appears to demonstrate that fact is indeed sometimes stranger than fiction.” Fremantle’s group COO Andrea Scrosati added: “There are rare moments in history when leaders find their private lives uniquely connected to national events, where personal experience and official role collide in an unusual way. The last few months in the life of the UK prime minister clearly mark one of these moments.” The events of 2020 will give Winterbottom much to draw on. The prime minister was admitted to hospital on 5 April, despite having previously said he was only suffering with a “mild” version of the illness. He was later moved to intensive care, and recuperated at Chequers before returning to Downing Street on 26 April. His first child with Carrie Symonds, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, was born shortly after, on 29 April. The government response to the pandemic has been widely regarded as a chaotic one, with the UK suffering the highest death toll in Europe. Cummings’s decision to break lockdown rules, first reported by the Guardian and the Mirror in a joint investigation on 22 May, has only added to what many have seen as incompetent leadership. A broadcaster is yet to be attached to the television project.
