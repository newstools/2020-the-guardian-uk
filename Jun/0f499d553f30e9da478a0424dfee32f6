In 1960s Britain photography was not regarded as a mainstream art form. As Sue Davies noted, the major London institutions were “very snooty” about the medium. The two decades she spent at the helm of the Photographers’ Gallery demonstrated how it covered so many areas of endeavour – the obvious are advertising and fashion, but also pop music, climate change, anthropology, disability – it was capable of thought-provoking imagery in every walk of life. Without Sue’s contribution the art of photography would still be lingering at the bottom of the stairs.
