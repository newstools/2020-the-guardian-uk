Hundreds of events around the world will mark World Oceans Day on 8 June, from beach cleanups in Morocco, to live streams from conservationists in Timor-Leste, to an exhibit of artwork created from marine debris in Hawaii. This year there is a focus on calling for world leaders to commit to protecting 30% of oceans by 2030, to combat the climate crisis and protect marine biodiversity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year’s celebrations will be different, with many events taking place online or in a socially-distanced way. We’d like to hear about what local ocean issues you are most concerned about. Do you often find plastic on your nearest beaches? Or perhaps you’ve noticed less water pollution recently, as we saw in Venice during lockdown. Do you live near a marine habitat that is being destroyed, or successfully restored? Maybe you are part of a fishing community, and want to see a balance between sustainability and livelihoods. Are you worried about rising sea levels near you? Or perhaps you live or work at sea, and want to share your experiences of conservation issues you’ve come across. Are you planning to take part in an event? If so we’d like to hear about it.
