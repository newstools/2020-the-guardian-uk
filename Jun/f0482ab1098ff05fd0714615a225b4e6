Phil Foden has become the latest footballer to fall foul of physical-distancing guidelines during lockdown, after the Manchester City midfielder was pictured in an impromptu kickabout with members of the public on Formby beach. City intend to speak to the 20-year-old and remind him of his responsibilities, not least because beach football carries the risk of injury in addition to the dangers of spreading coronavirus. Premier League players have been told to maintain physical distancing at all times other than during their permitted contact training sessions and advised to stay at home and avoid even going to the shops. Group exercise for the public is not allowed with people from outside one’s household. Foden joined in a couple of dribbling challenges before posing for a group photograph in proximity to his fellow players. Last month, City decided against disciplining Kyle Walker after the defender contravened lockdown rules for a second time when visiting his parents and sister. This came after the defender apologised following a report he held a party at his house with two sex workers present, breaking lockdown rules. In April, the mother of City’s manager, Pep Guardiola, died from coronavirus. Dolors Sala Carrió was 82.
