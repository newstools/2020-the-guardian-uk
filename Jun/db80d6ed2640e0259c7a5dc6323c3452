A 60-year-old man has died after being bitten by a shark while surfing near Kingscliff in northern NSW. NSW Police confirmed the death after witnesses reported seeing a three-metre-long shark attack the manâ€™s left leg while surfing at Salt Beach shortly after 10am on Sunday. A Surf Life Saving NSW spokesman told Guardian Australia the man succumbed to his wounds at about 10.40am. Several board-riders tried to help the 60-year-old, with some of them fighting off the shark so he could be taken to shore, according to police. Authorities believe the 60-year-old, who has not yet been identified, is from Queensland. The beach has been cleared, and helicopters, jet skis and drones have been deployed to locate the shark.
