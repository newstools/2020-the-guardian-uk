This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from Perth Museum and Art Gallery, holder of one of the oldest public collections in the UK. The collections formed by the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth were originally housed in a building known as the Marshall Monument, which opened in 1824. This structure now forms part of Perth Museum and Art Gallery, which opened in its current form in 1935. The fine art collection is displayed in changing exhibitions throughout the year. You can see art from the museum and gallery on Art UK here. Find out more on the collection’s website here.
