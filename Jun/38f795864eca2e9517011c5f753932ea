Mikel Arteta believes Bukayo Saka will soon sign a new contract at Arsenal and put to bed one of the sagas that could lead to a turbulent summer at the club. Saka’s emergence has arguably been the brightest aspect of a troubled season but Arsenal have been at risk of the 18-year-old, whose deal ends next June, being plucked by one of many suitors. It would represent a crushing blow if the academy product, who has played on the wing and at left-back, believed he could better continue his career elsewhere but Arteta is optimistic that will not be the case. “I am very positive that everything is going to be done with Bukayo very shortly,” the manager said. “The communications between the club, agents and the family has been going on for months and is very fluent. The player and family knows how much trust I have in him. He is just showing that every week and his consistency level is getting better and better. “I’m so excited with the young players that we have. They just need the right environment around them to explode and Bukayo is doing that, even in difficult circumstances, which is even more merit for him.” Securing Saka’s commitment would be a significant boost for Arteta, who has had to juggle that concern with uncertainty over Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s future and a miserable first two matches since Premier League football recommenced. Before Saturday’s defeat at Brighton he suggested Arsenal had “no margin for error” in aiming for the European spots; they visit Southampton on Thursday and seem unlikely to close an 11-point gap to the top four. “Until we start to win games the Champions League objective is too far at the moment,” Arteta said. “My only focus is [to] go to Southampton and get the three points, win, lift the players and start believing again that we can get wins again in a row.”
