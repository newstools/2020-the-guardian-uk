Love has won the 1,000 Guineas at 4-1 as Aidan O’Brien continued his domination of the fillies’ Classic despite the travel restrictions imposed to combat coronavirus. The Ballydoyle man has now sent over the winner of the Newmarket race six times in total and won four of the last five runnings, with Love as impressive as any of them, pulling four lengths clear of a big field in the closing stages. It has been O’Brien’s habit in recent years to send several runners for the 1,000 but Love was his only contender on this occasion and that faith proved justified. The favourite, Quadrilateral, ran well to be third but had no answers for the Ryan Moore-ridden chestnut in the final furlong. Cloak Of Spirits stayed on dourly to be second at 12-1 having made much of the running on a day when front-running tactics were often rewarded. Millisle, another Irish raider, was a disappointing seventh. A late gamble on Raffle Prize into 9-2 never looked like paying off and Mark Johnston’s runner was never seen with a serious chance before finishing last. “She’s a very uncomplicated filly, we’ve always thought a lot of her,” Moore said. “She won the Moyglare last year and we kind of expected her to win the Fillies Mile. It was a bit soft that day, maybe.“She’s a typical Galileo filly. If it wasn’t for her last run, last year, you’d have been pretty confident that she was the one to beat today and she was in control of the race from a long way out. She won as she liked, really.”Asked about the Oaks, for which Love is now the general 6-4 favourite, Moore said it was “a possibility” the filly would have enough stamina for the extra half-mile at Epsom in a month’s time, though he stressed that he had not discussed plans with O’Brien.
