With the Colosseum, Leaning Tower of Pisa and Uffizi gallery – not to mention Italy’s thousands of bars, cafes, restaurants and gelaterias – open to foreign visitors this week, we’d love to hear about your favourite memory of what is Brits’ third most-popular holiday destination. It may be a while before we can head off to enjoy la dolce vita, but in the meantime tell us all about your top Italian experience – maybe a family-run trattoria or idyllic agriturismo, a gorgeous beach or an amazing walking trail, a vineyard or an art gallery. Please use the form below to explain what made this place so special for you, including precise locations and websites where possible, and keeping your tip to around 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 9 June at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide, please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week.  If you’re having trouble using the form, click here
