Drab City make strangely cinematic music, full of flutes, vibraphones, soft vocals and glitchy beats. Their sound recalls bands such as Broadcast, Tindersticks and Portishead, who emerged in the 1990s in thrall to the eerie sounds of the 1960s – but Drab City present themselves differently. Rough-and-ready beings in their DIY videos and on their graffiti-slathered website, their lyrics are also more savage.Debut track Working for the Men appeared online in February, tailor-made for a folk horror film. It told the story of a woman who worked “down by the water”, cleaning for men who gave her “a silver penny”, before boats would arrive, load their cannons and kill them. Other songs followed, mixing pretty vibes and paranoid scenes, such as Devil Doll and Troubled Girl, with an intro that conjured up a darker version of the Shangri-Las.Drab City, who haven’t revealed much about themselves in their current guise, are US witch-house pioneer oOoOO (aka Chris Dexter Greenspan) and Berlin-based producer Islamiq Grrrls, aka Asia (we don’t know her surname, only that she’s Bosnian-Muslim and grew up in Germany). They have worked together before though: their 2018 joint album Faminine Mystique offered a more club-led iteration to the sound they create now. Their new LP as Drab City, Good Songs for Bad People, has just been released on Bella Union. It shores up stronger, more haunting songs and a strangeness that feels fitting for our surreal times.
