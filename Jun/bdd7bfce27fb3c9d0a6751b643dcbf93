We’re coming to the end of alphonso season, but the puree base of this drink freezes very well, so you can enjoy that unique taste long after the fruit disappears from the shops for another year. Serves 1 For the mango puree (makes enough for 4 serves)50g alphonso mango flesh35g caster sugar35ml water For the drink 50ml cachaça (we use Avuá Cachaça Prata)10ml dry white vermouth (optional)30ml mango puree, see above (or mango nectar)30ml fresh lime juice25ml coconut water – one with no added sugar: the puree is sweet enough already1 cube fresh mango, to garnish First make the puree, which is essentially a thick mango syrup: put the mango, sugar and water in a blender, and blitz smooth. For the drink, put everything in a cocktail shaker, fill with ice and shake vigorously. Strain into a chilled coupe, garnish with a cube of fresh mango on a cocktail stick and serve. • Oren Coleman, bar manager, Rovi, London W1.
