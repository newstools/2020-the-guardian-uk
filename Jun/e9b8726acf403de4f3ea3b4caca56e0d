I’ve read my four column inches relating to classical music in Friday’s G2 Film & Music section. I’ve got to be honest, after excellent editorials (The Guardian view on the return of live music: hope and longing, 7 June) and open letters (UK orchestras may not survive coronavirus pandemic, conductors warn, 10 June) about the importance and difficulties of classical music, I had hoped for more.Paul MichellBristol • Wondered recently why I have two subscriptions to your paper – Kindle daily and Saturday print edition. But your editorial on the cabinet (The Guardian view on the cabinet: a paucity of talent, 11 June) made it all worthwhile. So spot-on.Patricia ToyGlenrothes, Fife • Brilliant graphic on your front page showing the fall in Britain’s GDP in April (UK GDP falls by record 20.4% in April as lockdown paralyses economy, 12 June). Will we need a broadsheet Guardian again in a month’s time so that you can fit in the next graph?Patrick HancockLondon • I take issue with complaint from Ursula Hutchinson about the new format of The Archers (Letters, 12, June). Susan Carter as a presenter on Radio Borchester is inspired. I gather there is a vacancy at LBC following the removal of Nigel Farage. I think I know the ideal candidate.Dr Martin PriceDinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan • Over our first cup of coffee on Saturday morning we reached question 10 in The quiz by Thomas Eaton (13 June) and I asked my wife: “What links: aspirin; cinnamon; cork; quinine?” Her immediate response: “Gin and tonic.” Much laughter ensued.Rob StephensonKilmersdon, Somerset • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
