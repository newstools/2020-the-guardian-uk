Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I haven’t had my hair cut since before the lockdown and it’s become a shaggy mess. Does anyone have any good tips for cutting men’s hair at home? I’ve heard Wahl clippers are good, but are there other decent makes? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
