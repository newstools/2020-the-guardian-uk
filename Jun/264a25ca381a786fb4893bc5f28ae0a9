Cook 250g of pasta in generously salted boiling water until tender. In a second pan, boil 200g of peas for 3-4 minutes, then drain them. Pesto simply implies that the ingredients are pounded together. You could have mint or coriander pesto Put 50g of basil leaves into a food processor with a generous pinch of salt, 4 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tbsp of pine kernels and a small clove of garlic. Process briefly, until you have a creamy paste, then scrape into a mixing bowl with a rubber spatula and beat in 2 tbsp of grated parmesan. Drain the pasta, leaving a couple of tablespoons of its cooking water behind in the pan, then return the pasta to the pan and add the drained peas. Stir in the basil sauce, toss everything gently together then divide between 2 shallow bowls. Serves 2 You could save the washing up by cooking the peas first, lifting them out with a stainless-steel kitchen spider or sieve then using the same water, deep and now more generously salted, in which to cook your pasta. You can use herbs or vegetables other than basil to make pesto, such as rocket or tender young spinach. Pesto simply implies that the ingredients have been pounded together, so you can have mint or coriander pesto, and can dispense with the parmesan should you wish. I often incorporate a few leaves of mint with the basil, or even some leaves of wild garlic. Broad beans will work beautifully here in place of the peas, though I would be tempted to pop them from their skins after cooking. You can do it while the pasta cooks. Peas and cheese is a fine combination, and I might be tempted to tear off some pieces of mozzarella or burrata and fold them in, at the very last moment, with the pasta and peas. It will soften even further in the heat of the pasta. Follow Nigel on TwitterÂ @NigelSlater
