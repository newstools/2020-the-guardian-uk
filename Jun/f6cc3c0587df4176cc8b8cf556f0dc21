For many of us, camping and caravanning will be the most viable holiday option this year, so we’d love to hear about great sites in beautiful locations. In England, campsites and caravan parks can open from 4 July; in Scotland they may open from 15 July but that date is under review. Wales is keeping its campsites closed for the time being but caravan parks will most likely be able to accept visitors from 13 July. In Northern Ireland, campsites and caravan parks can open from later this week (26 June). From this week we are once again awarding a prize for the best tip of the week, as judged by travel expert Tom Hall. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. The winner will receive a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature – ideal for the current situation. If possible please check that your favourite site is reopening at some point this summer and indicate when that might be. Whether it’s a family-oriented site or a base suitable for a wilderness adventure please share your recommendations, keeping your tip to about 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high quality and you are happy to share them, but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder.
