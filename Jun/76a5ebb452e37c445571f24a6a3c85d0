I emailed my MP, Sally-Ann Hart (Hastings and Rye), on 26 May to express my surprise that, after careful consideration of the known facts, she had reached the conclusion that Dominic Cummings had done the right thing, and asked her to reconsider her position following the negative response to Mr Cummings’ actions from many of her colleagues. To date I have not received an acknowledgment, let alone a reply (Constituents bombard MPs with tens of thousands of emails over Dominic Cummings, 29 May). My wife wrote to her later the same day, expressing similar views, but mentioned that, viewing the evidence as a retired judge, she had had some difficulty in understanding the conclusion Ms Hart, herself a lawyer, had reached. She received a reply from Ms Hart on 30 May, apologising for the delay and explaining that there had been an overwhelming postbag, but reiterating the position she had previously stated. Is there an algorithm that sorts out the wheat from the chaff and determines which of us is worth replying to, eventually?Christopher CotterRye, East Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
