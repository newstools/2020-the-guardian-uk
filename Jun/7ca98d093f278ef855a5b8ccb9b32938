This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Oriel Môn was founded in 1991, in Llangefni, Anglesey, and has strived to collect works with local relevance, which is reflected in the wide range of paintings held by the museum. Most of the paintings have been donated by private individuals and institutions, and these are supplemented with purchases made by its governing body, Isle of Anglesey County Council. You can see art from Oriel Môn on Art UK here. Find out more on the museum’s website here.
