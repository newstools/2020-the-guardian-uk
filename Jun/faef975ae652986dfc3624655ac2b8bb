This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by Horniman Museum and Gardens. The Horniman has collections across world cultures, music and the natural environment. The anthropology collection comprises approximately 80,000 objects from around the world – more than 3,000 of them displayed in the World Gallery – and provides a path into understanding the everyday lives and beliefs of people from all over the world, including ourselves. You can see art from Horniman Museum and Gardens on Art UK here. Find out more on the Horniman Museum and Gardens website.
