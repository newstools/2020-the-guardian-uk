This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Bodleian Libraries. They are research libraries of the University of Oxford, which also hold a historic collection of portraits in all media. You can see art from Bodleian Libraries on Art UK.
