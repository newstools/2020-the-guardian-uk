After voicing support for Woody Allen and criticizing cancel culture, Spike Lee apologized on Saturday for words he said were “wrong”. In an interview on Friday on the New York radio station WOR 710, Lee called Allen “a great, great film-maker”. “This cancel thing is not just Woody,” he said. “And I think that when we look back on it, [we’re] gonna see that, short of killing somebody, I don’t if you can just erase somebody like they never existed. “Woody’s a friend of mine. I know he’s going through it right now.” Allen has been accused of molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was seven years old in the early 1990s. He has long denied the allegation and was never charged. Earlier this year, Allen released a memoir through Arcade Publishing after his original publisher, Hachette Book Group, dropped the book amid widespread criticism. On Saturday, Lee tweeted an apology. “My words were WRONG,” he wrote. “I do not and will not tolerate sexual harassment, assault or violence. Such treatment causes real damage that can’t be minimized.” Lee’s latest film, the Vietnam war drama Da 5 Bloods, debuted on Friday on Netflix.
