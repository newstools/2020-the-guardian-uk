Restaurants and bars have opened up again in France, so it’s an ideal time to hear about your best holiday memories of country millions of UK citizens visit every year. Whether you’ve enjoyed cycling in the lush countryside, visiting museums and chateaux, eating and drinking out or just lying on a beach we’d love to hear your reminiscences. And don’t forget the chance encounters and locals’ tips that so often transform an experience on holiday. Please tell us about somewhere or something specific, not a general area or city. Use the form below to tell us what made this place so memorable for you, including precise location and website where possible, keeping your tip to around 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 23 June at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are welcome if they are high quality (at least 700 pixels wide, please) and you are happy to share them, but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week.
