Following the decision to slow down the return to school for most pupils, it is time for the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the government to admit to the critical nature of the situation and embark on a national campaign to be ready for the start of the new school year in September (Boris Johnson urged to set out recovery plan for schools in England, 9 June). I am a governor of a primary school and from the start, as soon as the headteacher made plans following distancing regulations, it was obvious that only a minority of pupils could be accommodated. Under the circumstances three things are needed. First, better internet connections for pupils. Second, an increase in school budgets so that extra accommodation can be sourced locally wherever possible, be it in sports centres, halls or portable buildings, and deep cleaning provided. Third, extra staffing, from among retired teachers or those on the supply list, with a recruitment programme set in motion now. It requires political will and leadership. No doubt plenty of us would volunteer to help get this set up. In the meantime, children and families are suffering and the damage will be long-lasting.
