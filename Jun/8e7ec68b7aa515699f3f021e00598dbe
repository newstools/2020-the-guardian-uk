A teenager who admitted attempting to murder a six-year-old boy by throwing him off the viewing platform at the Tate Modern gallery in London has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Jonty Bravery, 18 was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday. The six-year-old French boy, who was visiting London with his family, sustained a bleed to the brain, fractures to his spine and broken legs and arms following the fall from the 10th floor on to a fifth-floor roof. He cannot be named because of a reporting restriction. The victim spent several weeks in intensive care before returning to France to continue his recovery. Sentencing Bravery, of Ealing, west London, Mrs Justice McGowan said: “The fear he [the victim] must have experienced and the horror his parents felt are beyond imagination. “You had intended to kill someone that day – you almost killed that six-year-old boy.” She said Bravery’s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) did not explain the attack, and acknowledged the expert evidence that he presents “a grave and immediate risk to the public”. The judge added: “You will spend the greater part – if not all – of your life detained ... you may never be released.” Bravery sat impassively with his legs crossed and occasionally placed his hands behind his head as he watched the 20-minute hearing via video link from Broadmoor hospital. The court heard that at the time of the attack Bravery had been in supported accommodation under the care of Hammersmith and Fulham Social Services, with one-to-one supervision, and had a history of lashing out at staff. Despite this, he was allowed to leave home unsupervised for up to four hours at a time. The prosecutor Deanna Heer said there was evidence Bravery had long harboured an intention to seriously hurt or kill someone, with the teenager’s admissions apparently having been caught on a “shocking, prophetic” secret recording made by carers. This was not raised with Bravery’s parents.
