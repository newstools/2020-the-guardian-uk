A combination of sunny weather and the approaching relaxation of coronavirus lockdown rules in England has led to jubilation on some front pages today, as others mark the start of the end of “our long national hibernation”. “Summer’s back on!” says the Daily Mail, and quotes Boris Johnson urging people to get out and enjoy themselves. It notes, however, the move is a “calculated gamble to head off economic disaster”. Wednesday's @DailyMailUK #MailFrontPages pic.twitter.com/6s2AUncQhc The Express takes a similar tack. It uses a picture of the prime minister with beer held aloft alongside the headline: “Cheers Boris! Here’s to a brighter Britain”. It tempers the joy with a message across the top: “PM: we’re coming out of hibernation but virus still a risk”. Metro also uses the pub theme with “Get the beers in”.

It reports people are getting ready for “super Saturday” when pubs will open The prime minister’s “hibernation” comment was the pick of the rest of the papers. The Guardian balances the relief with the still-serious dangers the virus poses. “PM hails ‘end of hibernation’ – but scientists urge caution” is the headline, beside a grim-faced Johnson delivering the news of the “one-metre plus” rules coming in on 4 July.

Underneath, a comment piece by associate editor Camilla Tominey is headlined: “So we gingerly get back to normal – in a world that is anything but”. The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph:'Our hibernation is beginning to end, the bustle is coming back'#TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/eZPalq1XFj The Times has a straightforward: “Hibernation at an end” and a handy box of the incoming guidelines at a glance. It also joins other papers in looking at the life and death of film financier Steve Bing. The Mirror appears more discombobulated than celebratory in its treatment of the guidelines. “Life … but not as we know it”, is the headline above “Britain unlocked”.
