This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by FE McWilliam Gallery and Studio in County Down, Northern Ireland, established in 2008 to celebrate the work of Banbridge-born sculptor Frederick Edward McWilliam (1909-92). McWilliam worked in London, where he established a reputation as one of the most significant sculptors of his generation. Initially associated with surrealism, his sculptures in wood, stone and bronze are primarily figurative and often playful. You can see art from FE McWilliam Gallery and Studio on Art UK here.
