Starting in July, the new Israeli government has said that it intends to illegally annex large swathes of Palestinian land in the West Bank, which was militarily occupied in 1967. This would be the culmination of years of appropriation of land through the forced displacement of Palestinians and the illegal settlement of the West Bank and annexation of East Jerusalem. By annexing the West Bank, Israel would be taking over occupied Palestinian territory and making it an integral part of the Israeli state. Palestinian civil society has made a global call for “effective measures” to be taken to stop this annexation happening. For the UK, this means we should by now, at the very least, be adhering to an ethical policy on all trade with Israel, with a particular focus on applying international law on settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. We also need to end the UK’s arms trade with Israel, which results in the violation of the human rights of Palestinians. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of organisations and individuals are cooperating to try to respond to the call from Palestine by making annexation a live issue and bringing it to the forefront of the current political agenda. Israel’s timetable is to annex land quickly with President Trump’s support – this means we cannot wait any longer. This is why we are speaking out now, on the 53rd anniversary of Israel completing the military occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, calling upon the UK government and all UK political parties to heed the call of Palestinian civil society organisations for effective measures by all states in order to stop Israel’s illegal annexation. Jeremy Corbyn MPCaroline Lucas MPJohn McDonnell MPTommy Sheppard MPAndy Slaughter MPTessa Blackstone House of LordsChristine Blower House of LordsPeter Hain House of LordsJo Grady General secretary, UCULen McCluskey General secretary, Unite the UnionJohn Phillips Acting general secretary, GMBMark Serwotka General secretary, PCSMick Whelan General secretary, AslefDr Salman Abu SittaProf Kamel Hawwash Chair, Palestine Solidarity CampaignProf Karma NabulsiVictoria BrittainJulie ChristieWilliam DalrympleHarriet WalterIrvine WelshPhilip PullmanJoff Oddie, Ellie Rowsell, Theo Ellis and Joel Amey Members of the band Wolf Alice
