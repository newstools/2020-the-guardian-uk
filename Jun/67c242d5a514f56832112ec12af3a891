This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Bradford Museums and Galleries, in West Yorkshire. Centred on Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, the group holds a large collection of fine 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century oils by British, south Asian, French, Italian and Dutch artists. The collection comprises approximately 1,000 oil paintings, which is about a quarter of the total fine art collection. You can see some of the museum group’s artworks on Art UK here.
