This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are by Heritage Doncaster. The collection at Doncaster numbers around 2,000 items including paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and photographs. One area of particular strength is in works by 20th-century British artists including Frank Brangwyn, Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein. A recent addition is Terence Cuneo’s image of the Doncaster Plant Works, Giants Refreshed, which reflects Doncaster’s importance as a centre of locomotive building.
