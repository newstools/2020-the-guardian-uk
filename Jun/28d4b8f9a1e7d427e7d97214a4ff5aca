This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for Britain’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Swindon Museum and Art Gallery, which has one of the most significant collections of modern British art in the UK. It includes predominantly paintings and works on paper, around 300 studio ceramics and a number of sculptural works. The collection features artists including Frank Auerbach, Lucien Freud and Henry Moore, as well as artists of local significance. You can see art from Swindon Museum and Art Gallery on Art UK here.
