A US judge has awarded pop singer Billie Eilish a restraining order against a man who repeatedly visited her family home. Prenell Rousseau, 24, who lives on Long Island, New York, appeared outside Eilish’s Los Angeles home seven times on 4 and 5 May, before being arrested and sent back to New York, a court was told. A temporary restraining order was taken out, which has now been extended for three years. The order, made by Los Angeles County superior court, prevents Rousseau from attempting to contact Eilish or her parents, or coming within 100 yards (91 metres) of them. Eilish, who is 18, listened in to the Thursday hearing – conducted under coronavirus restrictions – but did not speak. She said in court documents that she and her family were frightened of Rousseau’s “erratic behaviour”, adding: “While we waited for security, Mr Rousseau remained on our porch, sat down and began to read a book, while also continuing to engage in a periodic monologue. My father repeatedly asked him to leave, but he refused.” Rousseau was finally arrested for trespassing. Eilish has become one of the most high-profile pop stars in the US, topping the album charts in the US and UK with her album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in 2019. She became only the second artist ever to win all four major Grammy categories for record, song and album of the year, and best new artist, in a single year. Also on Thursday, Eilish was one of more than 600 signatories of an open letter from the National Independent Venue Association to US Congress, warning that independent concert venues are at risk of closure following the coronavirus crisis. Lady Gaga, Dave Grohl, Neil Young and Coldplay are among the other artists pleading for government assistance for the venues. “The live music experience is inextricably tied to our nation’s cultural and economic fabric,” the letter argues.
