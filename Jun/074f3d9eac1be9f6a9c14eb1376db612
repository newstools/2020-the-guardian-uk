I’m not so sure about it ending “30 years of hurt” though (Signing Rosenthal and reeling in Villa: the last time Liverpool won the title, 25 June). As a lifelong Sunderland fan, now languishing in League One, I think I could have borne the pain of my club only winning three FA Cups, four league cups, two European Cups, one Uefa Cup, three European Super Cups and one Fifa World Club Championship over the last three decades.Kevin WilsonWhitley Bay, Tyne and Wear • Now that Swim England has stated that Covid-19 is not transmissible in chlorinated pool water (Letters, 24 June), I expect Boris to announce that he will immediately import enough US chlorinated chicken to safeguard the UK from the threatened second wave of infection.Terence AdamsMoseley, Birmingham • Perhaps the predictable breaches of the revised lockdown rules (Major incident declared as people flock to England’s south coast, 26 June) should now be referred to as “the Cummings effect”?Dr Brigid PurcellNorwich, Norfolk • How fitting for the author of These Are the Hands “that touch us first … and touch us last” that these are the hands that saved the life of Michael Rosen (Michael Rosen home from intensive care after coronavirus, 24 June).Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire • Bra-ssed off with brief letters now (Letters, 24 June).Mick BeebyBristol • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
