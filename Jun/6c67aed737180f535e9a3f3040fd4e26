This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set the Yale Center for British Art. The Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, holds the largest and most comprehensive collection of British art outside the UK, presenting the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period to the present day. The centre’s British art and books were the gift of Paul Mellon (1907–99), a graduate of Yale College (class of 1929). You can see art from the collection on Art UK here.
