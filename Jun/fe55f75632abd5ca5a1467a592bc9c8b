Season-ticket holders of Championship clubs will be able to watch any of their team’s league matches live for the rest of the 2019-20 season without an additional payment. Sky Sports will televise 30 of the 108 league matches scheduled and the 15 play-off matches across the three EFL divisions. Those 30 league games will also be available to season-ticket holders via the iFollow streaming service. The other 78 league matches will be available to fans via iFollow. Access to the games will be determined by the club where the supporter holds the season ticket, and may be in lieu of a refund or as part of a wider package determined by each club. Supporters without season tickets will be able to purchase a £10 match pass to watch individual matches on iFollow, the EFL said. The Championship season is set to resume on Saturday 20 June. Matches will be played at 6pm or 8pm on Fridays, 12.30pm, 3pm or 5.30pm on Saturdays and 12pm on Sundays. Midweek matches on Tuesdays and Wednesdays will kick off at 5pm, 6pm or 8pm. Sky will have exclusive access to the play-offs. The Championship play-off final is scheduled for Sunday 2 or Monday 3 August.
