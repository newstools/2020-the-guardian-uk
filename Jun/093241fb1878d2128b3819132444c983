A British man who spent six days trapped in a well after being chased by a dog has been rescued on the Indonesian island of Bali, authorities said on Sunday. A rescue team lifted 29-year-old Jacob Roberts from the four-metre-deep concrete pit after a farmer in Pecatu village raised the alarm. “Jacob’s calls for help were heard by a local who was going to feed his cows,” local search and rescue chief Gede Darmada told AFP. Roberts broke his leg when he stumbled into the near-empty reservoir. He told authorities he had been trying to evade a dog that chased him through the village. “He looked thin and injured,” South Kuta police chief Yusak Agustinus Sooai said after the Briton’s rescue on Saturday. Police took Roberts to a nearby hospital for treatment.
