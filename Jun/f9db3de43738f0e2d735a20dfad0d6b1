I assume this is a classic Grauniad typo and should read “daft” plans.Val HarrisonBirmingham • If the government is worried about new arrivals to the UK bringing in infection, why not test them at the border? They’d be quarantined for just 48 hours till the results come in, then if it’s negative they go free.Cristina HowickLondon • Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, thinks that we will recognise genuine track and trace callers because of the conversation we have with them.
