West Indies players will wear the Black Lives Matter logo on their shirts during the three-Test series against England that begins on 8 July in Southampton. Cricket West Indies received permission to use the logo from the Watford striker Troy Deeney, whose partner, Alisha Hosannah, created the design that incorporates a clenched fist of solidarity within a circle. The logo has appeared on shirts of Premier League players since the league resumed this month. The West Indies captain, Jason Holder, said: “This is a pivotal moment in history for sports, for the game of cricket and for the West Indies cricket team. We have come to England to retain the Wisden Trophy but we are very conscious of happenings around the world and the fight for justice and equality. We believe we have a duty to show solidarity and also to help raise awareness. “There must be equality and there must be unity. Until we get that as people, we cannot stop. We have to find some way to have equal rights and people must not be viewed differently because of the colour of their skin or ethnic background.” Deeney said: “Alisha and I are immensely proud to be asked and take part in a monumental moment in world sport, this amazing decision by the West Indies cricket team to show their support for Black Lives Matter. “When I got the call, I didn’t hesitate to respond, because I know as sportspersons in the spotlight how important our efforts are to bring about change and the role we play in move towards change in our society.”
