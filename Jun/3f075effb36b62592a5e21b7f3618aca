Manchester City have agreed a swap deal that has seen the young Portuguese winger Félix Correia join Juventus and the Spanish striker Pablo Moreno move in the opposite direction. Moreno is an 18-year-old No 9 who came through Barcelona’s academy and moved to Turin in 2018. He scored four goals in three Uefa Youth League games this season and has signed a five-year deal with City. He may well be loaned to Girona for the 2020-21 season. Correia, 19, is a winger with a playing style reminiscent of his countrymen Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani and has been with City since August 2019. He spent this season on loan at AZ Alkmaar, where he was playing for the under-21s. Correia has also agreed a five-year contract. Both players are valued at €10m (£8.9m) and both clubs have 10% sell-on clauses. The deal comes in the week Juve agreed a high-profile swap with Barcelona, signing Arthur for €72m (£66m) plus add-ons while selling Miralem Pjanic for around €60m. Juventus have also sold the 22-year-old midfielder Simone Muratore to Atalanta for €7m this week.
