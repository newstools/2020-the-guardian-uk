Anti-domestic violence campaigners have led criticism of the front page of Friday’s Sun newspaper which has an interview with JK Rowling’s first husband under the headline: “I slapped JK and I’m not sorry”. A sub-heading describes it as a “sick taunt”. The paper’s treatment of the story was condemned as giving voice to an alleged perpetrator of domestic abuse. Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that the Sun headline was “awful”. Gillian Martin, a member of the Scottish parliament, said on Twitter that the article would be “beyond triggering for many abuse survivors, and enabling to abusers”. “It is irresponsible and dangerous. I could weep for the way women are treated by the tabloid press – still – in 2020,” she said. Jay Mitchinson, editor of the Yorkshire Post, said his journalists reported every day on domestic abuse cases in the Yorkshire courts but the paper would never “blast up” an alleged perpetrator’s defence. The hashtag #dontbuythesun was trending on Twitter in the UK on Thursday night. The interview with Jorge Arantes comes amid a tumultuous few days for JK Rowling, who wrote in response to criticism of her public comments on transgender issues that she had been the victim of abuse in her first marriage, although she did not name Arantes. “I’m mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who’ve been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces,” she wrote.
