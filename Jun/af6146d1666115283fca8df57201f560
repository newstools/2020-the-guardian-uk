We can’t be the only subscribers dependent on newspaper deliveries. Rural village, no shop, no public transport. Yet every day our newsagent, Trevor, or his sister Glenda, deliver the Guardian. Some acknowledgement is overdue. Our thanks to all those who deliver the papers, in all weathers, during this lockdown.Victoria SmillieBawburgh, Norfolk • So since his illness Boris Johnson may be lethargic and with a reduced capacity for sustained work (Letters, 29 May). How can they tell?Phil WaldenBury St Edmund’s, Suffolk • You report that one of Boris Johnson’s alma maters is to close (Coronavirus closes prep school attended by Boris Johnson, 1 June), and that the school trust’s CEO said that Ashdown’s impact will be felt for generations to come.
