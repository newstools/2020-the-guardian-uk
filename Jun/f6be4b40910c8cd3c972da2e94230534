Grigor Dimitrov says he is “sorry for any harm I might have caused” after revealing he has tested positive for coronavirus. Dimitrov appeared at the Serbian and Croatian legs of the Adria Tour, losing in straight sets to Borna Coric at the latter event on Saturday. The final of the event, which would have featured the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, was cancelled as a result. “I want to reach out and let my fans and friends know that I tested positive back in Monaco for Covid-19,” Dimitrov wrote on Instagram. “I want to make sure anyone who has been in contact with me during these past days gets tested and takes the necessary precautions. “I am so sorry for any harm I might have caused. I am back home now and recovering. Thanks for your support and please stay safe and healthy.”
