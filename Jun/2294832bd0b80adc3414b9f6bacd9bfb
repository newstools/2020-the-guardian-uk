Here is a summary of latest developments at a glance: Three people were killed and at least three others sustained serious injuries in a stabbing rampage in Forbury Gardens in Reading town centre at 7pm on Saturday evening. One of the people killed was named as James Furlong who was head of history, government and politics at The Holt School in Wokingham. There were several witnesses to the attacks, which took place as people were relaxing in the park, and disturbing videos have emerged on social media showing scenes of victims receiving resuscitation treatment. A 25-year-old Libyan national, whose mental health is being considered as a major factor in the incident according to security sources, is being held by police over the incident. The suspect has been named by multiple sources as Khairi Saadallah, a Libyan refugee. Security sources said he had been granted asylum and had previously been in prison for a relatively minor offence, not a terrorism conviction. Counter-terrorism officers were seen among a group of officers entering a block of flats in Reading, where the suspect is understood to have been living, at around 11pm on Saturday. Counter-Terrorism Policing South East will take over the investigation from Thames Valley police after declaring the attack a terrorist incident. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, chaired a meeting at 9am on Sunday in No 10 to be updated on the latest developments. The home secretary, Priti Patel, was present, as well as police and security officials.
