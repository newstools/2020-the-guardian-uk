I will not shoot myselfIn the head, and I will not shoot myselfIn the back, and I will not hang myselfWith a trashbag, and if I do, I promise you, I will not do itIn a police car while handcuffedOr in the jail cell of a townI only know the name ofBecause I have to drive through itTo get home. Yes, I may be at risk,But I promise you, I trust the maggotsWho live beneath the floorboardsOf my house to do what they mustTo any carcass more than I trustAn officer of the law of the landTo shut my eyes like a manOf God might, or to cover me with a sheetSo clean my mother could have used itTo tuck me in. When I kill me, I willDo it the same way most Americans do, I promise you: cigarette smokeOr a piece of meat on which I chokeOr so broke I freeze In one of these winters we keepCalling worst. I promise if you hearOf me dead anywhere nearA cop, then that cop killed me. He took Me from us and left my body, which is, No matter what we’ve been taught, Greater than the settlementA city can pay a mother to stop crying,And more beautiful than the new bulletFished from the folds of my brain. One month ago – though it seems like an aeon – when Jericho Brown won the 2020 Pulitzer prize for poetry, his collection The Tradition was held up alongside other winners that included, among others: an investigation into a long pattern of deaths in a small Texas county jail; an exposé of the former Kentucky governor’s choice to pardon hundreds of white inmates over people of colour; a 400-year history of the legacy of black slavery; and an off-Broadway musical about a black, gay usher struggling to find his own voice in a white world. Like so many writers who have written about racism over centuries, Brown has acquired a new audience in the wake of terrible violence. His poem Bullet Points, printed in The Tradition, has been widely shared on social media in the wake of the killing of George Floyd on 25 May. Brown himself has said that Bullet Points “was not born out of a sense of protest from me. It’s a poem born out of a sense of desperation that comes from a fact of my life. I don’t want anybody saying that I killed myself if I’m ever in police custody.” In all of Brown’s poetry – in addition to The Tradition, he has written two other collections, Please and The New Testament – serene moments of peace and gentle intimacies live side by side with an unshakeable awareness of violence and horror. His elegiac poems mourn all that is denied black men, and also what is inflicted on them; in his poem Stand, Brown writes: “I’m sure / Somebody died while / We made love. Some- / Body killed somebody / Black. I thought then / Of holding you / As political act.” Love and pain are inseparable, as are benevolence and brutality, the sacred and the sacrilegious, pleasure and horror. And so, in the face of systemic violence, Brown shows that transcendent joy, sensuousness and peace can all still be found within black bodies, in a world that condemns them to stay vulnerable.
