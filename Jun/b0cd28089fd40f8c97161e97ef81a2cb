What on earth justifies Jacinda Ardern’s inappropriate triumphalism after reducing coronavirus rates in New Zealand to zero (Report, 8 June)? They only achieved 24 deaths. Pathetic! Look at our world-beating stats. Under Hancock’s guidance we’ve achieved 60,000 deaths and got the daily rate down from over 1,000 to less than 100, all while creating an NHS treatment backlog of only 10 million or so. Now that’s what I call cause for celebration.Clive StephensFrome, Somerset • Saturday’s cartoon depicting ministers wearing masks provoked the thought that they are unlikely to be wearing them during interviews and updates. What’s the noun that usually follows bare-faced?Geoff ReidBradford • To suggest that someone annoyed by others’ music in the park should buy headphones (Letters, 7 June) is to miss the point. Responsibility lies with the perpetrator, not the victim. If someone blew smoke in your face, you wouldn’t expect to have to buy a gas mask.Patrick BeesleyCrewe, Cheshire • Why is the crocodile in Spain described in passive terms (Spanish police search river after sightings of Nile crocodile, 8 June)? It’s an escaper. Same applies to those who take part in events – attenders, not attendees.Margaret WaddyCambridge • Is lockdown changing us into a nation of cyclists, you ask (G2, 9 June). I hope so, but we may have to wait until well into winter before the question can be answered.David ParsonsLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
