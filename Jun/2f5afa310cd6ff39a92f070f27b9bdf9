Scott McTominay has signed a new contract at Manchester United to 2025 with the option of a further year. The 23-year-old has established himself in midfield, having made his debut under Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s predecessor, José Mourinho, as a late substitute in a 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in May 2017. McTominay said: “Whilst I understand we all have so many other things to think about at the moment, I’m so happy to sign this contract and play a part in the future for this team. I want to thank the manager for the faith he has shown in me and everyone at the club that has helped me to get where I am today. I’m looking forward to finishing this season on a high and hopefully achieving our aims.” Solskjær said: “Scott has done tremendously well since I joined [in December 2018] and has been a vital part of our midfield. He brings determination, tenacity and skill to the game and we know that Scott’s attributes will be a major asset to the squad over the coming years. “As we always say the academy is the bedrock of the club and having come through the system everyone knows Scott has shown the exact mentality you need to succeed at Manchester United. I look forward to seeing his continued improvement.”
