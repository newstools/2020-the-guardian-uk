It has taken 30 years, 58 days and the return from a three-month lockdown caused by a global pandemic but, finally, Liverpool are champions of England once again. The club’s 19th championship and first of the Premier League era was confirmed after Manchester City’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea. An emphatic defeat of Crystal Palace on Wednesday put them within two points of the title but that proved academic after City’s slip at Stamford Bridge. The now deposed Premier League champions trail their successors by a remarkable 23 points with seven matches remaining and will be expected to provide a guard of honour when the two clubs meet at the Etihad Stadium next Thursday. Guards of honour are traditional, not compulsory, and require the agreement of all parties. Jürgen Klopp watched the City game at Formby Hall golf club together with the players as Liverpool clinched the crown that has eluded them since Kenny Dalglish led the club to its last championship on 28 April 1990. Madonna was No 1 in the UK singles chart at the time with Vogue. Liverpool have won the Premier League title, Champions League, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup within 13 extraordinary months and are on course to demolish several domestic records this season, many held by City. Liverpool have won the Premier League with most games to spare, breaking the record of five held jointly by City (2017-18) and Manchester United (2000-01). They could end the campaign with a staggering 107 points, eclipsing the record of 100 set by City in 2017-18, most victories in a Premier League season (usurping City’s 32 from 2017-18 and 2018-19), most home wins and the biggest title-winning points margin. City currently hold that distinction in the Premier League with 19 points in 2017-18 but the overall record of 23 belongs to Middlesbrough and West Ham when winning the second division in 1974 and 1981 respectively. Jordan Henderson will have to wait until late July to lift the Premier League trophy and while the ban on mass gatherings prevents a parade through Liverpool city centre the club plan to hold a celebration with supporters when it is deemed safe to do so.
