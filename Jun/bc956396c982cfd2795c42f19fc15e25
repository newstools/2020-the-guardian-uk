Kevin De Bruyne has said that Manchester City’s season will be unbelievable if they can win the Champions League and FA Cup. City’s defence of the Premier League ended in Thursday’s 2-1 defeat at Chelsea, with Liverpool becoming champions for the first time in 30 years. Yet De Bruyne, with City having won the Carabao Cup for a third successive year, is focused on defending the FA Cup and winning the Champions League. In the former competition City travel to Newcastle United for Sunday’s quarter-final, and in the latter they hold a 2-1 advantage over Real Madrid before next month’s last-16 second leg. De Bruyne said: “We have still got big chances in the FA Cup and Champions League. Imagine if we come out after winning these cups, it will be an unbelievable season. We have got a lot to play for and look forward to it.” Liverpool hold a 23-point lead over City with seven league matches remaining. “You are always disappointed when you don’t win,” said the midfielder. “But we are honest enough to say Liverpool were better this year. We worked really hard, we played really well but we weren’t good enough and that’s no problem for us to admit. If everything goes to plan for us then I think we still have 13 or 14 games [remaining], so we still have a lot to play for and a lot of objectives.”
