I’ve never seen her live, but I remember watching a Joan Rivers standup special for the first time and literally thinking she was magic. Jackass’s “Poo-Cano” in which Dave England paints his butt to blend in to a diorama of a scenic countryside, and then starts explosively shitting upwards into the air, creating, famously, a “Poop Volcano”. Genius. John Waters’s Shock Value. In every John Waters book, you’re like: “Wait, how can this guy be so funny in a … book?” It’s like you can hear his voice talking to you through the page. Brass Eye! That show literally makes my whole head explode. Maybe Spinal Tap? I just saw it for the first time recently. Every day is a new day to find out you’re an idiot for not having seen, like, the coolest movie ever. After my grandma died, I got to keep all her prosthetic glass eyeballs (she had one missing eye … you couldn’t even tell). So, naturally, I made a necklace out of one of the eyeballs. It’s my good-luck pendant. I was eating by myself at a diner in Chicago and I watched a guy choke himself with a belt in between bites of scrambled eggs. Yeah, I don’t know what to make of that either. Long Normal Hair. My dad was working in Manhattan during 9/11 and saw it happening. He took a piece of rubble, and now he keeps it in a drawer like a souvenir. I know it’s not funny, but I think it’s pretty funny to think of a 9/11 souvenir, like it’s from a Disneyland giftshop or something. Follow Sarah on Twitter @SarahSquirm
