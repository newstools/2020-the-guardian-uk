Crystal Palace are getting closer to signing Nathan Ferguson after West Brom confirmed the 19-year-old defender had rejected a new contract. Ferguson’s move to Selhurst Park in January was scuppered by a knee injury and he had surgery in February. Palace had agreed a fee of £8m but a tribunal looks set to decide the amount after Ferguson’s departure from the Hawthorns on 30 June was confirmed. “We have made what can only be considered a very attractive offer to Nathan but he intends to pursue his career elsewhere,” the West Brom sporting and technical director, Luke Dowling, told the club’s website. “It’s a disappointment for everyone here but it is the player’s prerogative.” The Birmingham-born Ferguson joined West Brom at the age of eight and has made 21 starts this season as they chase a return to the Premier League. He is expected to complete his rehabilitation at Palace and will compete with Joel Ward for the right-back spot. Palace have also shown an interest in signing the Canada striker Jonathan David from Gent but it is understood the 20-year-old favours a move to Germany. Jeffrey Schlupp, James Tomkins and Martin Kelly will miss the trip to Liverpool on Wednesday and remain “unavailable for a period of time”, although Roy Hodgson othwerwise has a full squad to choose from as Palace attempt to record a fifth consecutive victory.
