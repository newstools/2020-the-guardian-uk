This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Scarborough Museums Trust. The trust manages Scarborough Art Gallery and the Rotunda Museum, built in 1829 and one of the world’s first purpose-built museums. Alongside works by Atkinson Grimshaw, William Etty, Matthew Smith and Frank Brangwyn and a lively contemporary art programme, the trust holds significant natural and social history collections, dinosaur footprints, artefacts from the world-famous Star Carr archaeological site and the remains of Gristhorpe Man – one of the most important bronze age burials ever discovered. You can see art from the trust on Art UK here. Find out more on the Scarborough Museums Trust website.
