Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been defaced yet again, this time in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, social media posts first alerted a wider audience to the latest attempt which saw the star spray painted black with the letters BLM underneath and what’s allegedly a bag of dog feces on top. The day saw around 20,000 people march down Hollywood Boulevard to protest ongoing police brutality in the US after the murder of George Floyd. Trump has come under fire for his attempts to further fan the flames, threatening violence against those protesting across the nation. Since the reality TV host became US president in 2016, there have been a number of attempts to vandalise his star including, most successfully, a pickaxe attack in 2018. In 2016, James Lambert Otis, 53, was also recorded using a jackhammer and a pickaxe to remove Trump’s name. The star has also been the subject of protest art, with a wall erected around it in 2016 to symbolize the president’s policy on immigration. The Celebrity Apprentice host, accused of sexually harassing or abusing 25 women, received his star in 2007. In 2018, West Hollywood City Council voted to remove it, a largely symbolic gesture as the star isn’t actually in West Hollywood. The strip in Hollywood features multiple stars dedicated to celebrities, with recently announced honorees including Spike Lee, Octavia Spencer and Julia Roberts. Recipients are selected by a committee that considers applications throughout the year and stars are purchased for $30,000. Other celebrities who have seen their stars vandalised include convicted rapist Bill Cosby and Ellen Degeneres.
