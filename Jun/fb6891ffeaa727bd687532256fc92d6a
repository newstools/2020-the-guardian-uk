Lord North became a well-backed winner of the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes, delivering victory for John Gosden in the feature race on day two at Royal Ascot. Sent off at 5-1, the ex-handicapper had been twice those odds on Wednesday morning and justified the support by pulling clear of Addeybb in the closing stages. For once, Frankie Dettori appears to have made the wrong choice between two Gosden runners, as he was aboard Mehdaayih. She showed up well before fading into sixth; it was James Doyle who came in for the winning ride in a race he has taken before aboard Al Kazeem and Poet’s Word. Coolly, he settled Lord North in last place through the early stages before launching him in the straight. “He quickened up like a really nice horse, a proper horse,” Doyle said. “He travelled into it great, showed a good turn of foot. I’d like to ride him again, put it that way.” Lord North now appears a potential contender for the Eclipse, though that could mean a clash with his famous stablemate Enable. It now appears he was extremely well treated when he won the Cambridgeshire in September. His career echoes that of Halling, who won the Cambridgeshire for Gosden before landing the Eclipse in consecutive years. Japan was a disappointing favourite, staying on at one pace in the straight to finish in a bunch of horses and just outside the places. Aidan O’Brien’s runner, fourth in the Arc when last seen, may have needed this return to action. He used up some energy early in the race when rushed up close to the pace after a slow start. Barney Roy stayed on into third. Headman was a disappointing last.
