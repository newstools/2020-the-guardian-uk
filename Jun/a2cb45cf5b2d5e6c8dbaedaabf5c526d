Bayern Munich have been crowned Bundesliga champions for an eighth successive season after a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Bayern’s domination of German football continues as an 11th successive win means Borussia Dortmund can no longer catch them. It was fitting that Robert Lewandowski’s goal earned the title, with the Poland striker’s 31st league strike of the season enough to see off struggling Bremen – even a red card for Alphonso Davies late on could not sour the evening. The manner of Bayern’s 29th champonship, with a three-month suspension, will live long in the memory thanks to the scintillating style of play introduced by Hansi Flick, who took over from Niko Kovac in November. They have been particularly fearsome since the restart last month and on this form will be strong contenders to win the Champions League later this summer. Borussia Mönchengladbach strengthened their Champions League hopes with a 3-0 win against Wolfsburg. Jonas Hofman’s two first-half goals put them in command before Lars Stindl made it a comfortable evening. Elsewhere, Union Berlin beat bottom club Paderborn 1-0 to secure their survival and Europa League hopefuls Freiburg were 2-1 winners over Hertha Berlin. In Spain Barcelona extended their lead over Real Madrid at the top of La Liga to five points with a 2-0 win at home to Leganés. Goals from Ansu Fati and Lionel Messi gave Barça the three points and kept the pressure on Real, who play Valencia on Thursday. Fati, 17, became the second-youngest player ever to score five league goals when he fired home three minutes before the break. Messi scored his 26th goal of the campaign from the penalty spot in the second half. Carlos Bacca’s early close-range finish was enough to give Villarreal a 1-0 win over Mallorca, while 10-man Espanyol, who had Bernardo Espinosa sent off in the 16th minute, held out for a 0-0 draw at Getafe.
