British ministers are seeking to scale back plans for a £5bn satellite navigation system that was introduced in 2018 as an alternative to the EU’s Galileo project, it has been reported. The ministers are exploring other options, which include using OneWeb, the UK satellite operator that went bankrupt in March, the Financial Times reported, citing sources. OneWeb has pledged to move its satellite production from Florida in the US to the UK if its management wins government support for its bid, according to the report. Plans for an independent satellite system were announced in 2018 by the then prime minister, Theresa May to ensure national security in the event that Britain were banned from equal access to the EU programme after Brexit. The satellite program was expected to potentially rival EU’s Galileo system, which is designed to compete with the US Global Positioning System (GPS), used for commercial, military and other critical applications such as guiding aircraft.
