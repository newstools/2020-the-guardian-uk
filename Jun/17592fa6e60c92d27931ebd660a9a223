This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Williamson Art Gallery & Museum, Birkenhead. The Williamson has a broad collection specialising in British art and decorative art, particularly local to the Merseyside and North Wales area, and with a strong maritime slant with many ship models on show. You can see art from Williamson Art Gallery & Museum, Birkenhead on Art UK here. Visit the museum’s website here.
