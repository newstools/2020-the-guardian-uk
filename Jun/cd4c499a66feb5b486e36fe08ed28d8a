Robin Carhart-Harris says that the impact of psychedelic therapy is profound, with people experiencing emotional catharsis and physical rejuvenation (We can no longer ignore the potential of psychedelic drugs to treat depression, 8 June).

It is remote, with lots of mud to sling, and located slap-bang next to a military firing range – Foulness.Neil BaldwinBig Sur, California, United States • Your editorial (The Guardian view on a green new deal: save jobs and the planet, 9 June) asks “but where’s the beef?” But surely that’s the problem – the correct way forward is veganism.Delphine PenfoldKidlington, Oxfordshire • Well there’s cryptic and there’s cryptic. But I have to say that the answer to “Boris Johnson is one…” (25 across, crossword No 28,157, 11 June) wasn’t the word that immediately sprang to mind.Simon TownleyToddington, Bedfordshire • I am nearly 97 years of age. Is what is left of my future still planned by someone who did a bunk when the going got tough?Peter T BlackerDorchester, Dorset • If The Archers monologues are to go on, they need to ask Alan Bennett to write them. We’ve just endured a week of Tony’s haircut.
