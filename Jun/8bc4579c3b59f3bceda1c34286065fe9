He has always looked bright as the dark closed in on Werder Bremen, stood up and pointed the way forward. This time was different. Usually a beacon of positivity – a quality that has seen the club stick with him long after many of their counterparts would have happily jettisoned him – Florian Kohfeldt was deflated, the bottom of his deep well of optimism finally visible. In the minutes following Werder’s 3-1 defeat at Mainz, the head coach said he felt “empty”. In a must-win game they had started well, stumbled and then collapsed in an all-too-familiar fashion. They had even come perilously close to being relegated on the day, and would have been had Fortuna Düsseldorf’s Rouwen Hennings made a better connection with a stoppage-time header against Augsburg. Werder’s top-flight tenure is hanging by a thread, but the thread is still holding. Just. Next Saturday, they must beat Köln and hope Fortuna lose at Union – unless they, improbably, can win by at least four, in which case a draw at the already-safe Berliners would leave Fortuna vulnerable – just to crawl into third-bottom and grasp the chance of reprieve via the relegation play-off. Köln would be a godsend of a final-day task under normal circumstances, with Effzeh already safe and badly out of form, but asking Werder to win at their Weser home, let alone by a handsome score, is asking a lot. They have not won a Bundesliga fixture there since 1 September. So when Kicker writes that Werder must hope for “a little football miracle”, they are not exaggerating. Their fall from grace and out of the top league has been on the cards for some months – in fact, the warning signs have been there for a few years – but it is a sobering reality that they are now facing. It is seismic not just for the club but for the Bundesliga too, of which the northerners have been such a constant. Werder have currently spent more seasons in the top flight than Bayern Munich, and relegation would see them back in the second tier for the first time since 1981, when Otto Rehhagel was at the helm, then a young coach beginning to forge what would become a formidable reputation. It would appear Kohfeldt is unlikely to grow into the same bracket but he is still highly thought of at Werder, and even if the team do tumble into the Bundesliga 2, his sacking is not assured. Former general manager Willi Lemke told Sky that some “very lively discussions” about the coach’s future would be forthcoming but Kohfeldt’s most staunch defender, sporting director Frank Baumann, has not cast him adrift yet. “We have already said we will look at all subjects after the season,” Baumann told Weser Kurier on Sunday. “That is totally clear. But it is also clear that we basically have conviction in Florian Kohfeldt.” Kohfeldt has certainly had conviction in himself, and that is what fleetingly looked like it might pull Werder out of the mire post-resumption. The first game back had been typical of the season so far, a 4-1 defeat at home (of course) to Bayer Leverkusen in which they played acceptably in patches and let in infuriatingly cheap goals from set-pieces. Against a background of worried fans and naysaying ex-players, Kohfeldt was bold in the press conference that followed, declaring himself the best man for the job. The following day they won at Freiburg, the first of three consecutive victories on the road that led them to Mainz. They had their chances early on through Josh Sargent and Leonardo Bittencourt, but once Robin Quaison put the home side in front with a scruffy goal, it looked bleak. Danny Latza and Jean-Paul Boëtius were allowed to stroll through for the second and although the tail wagged when Yuya Osako pulled one back, the game was up long before Edimilson Fernandes netted a late third. Kohfeldt had, wrote Kicker’s Thiemo Müller “obviously trusted his team to do much more than they can demonstrably do,” and while Baumann’s role is assembling them must come under the microscope, considerable ire is being trained on the players who have been unable to respond. “If football were all about talking,” Jean-Julian Beer of Weser Kurier charged, “Werder would be in the Champions League, maybe even champions. The sobering truth is this Bremen team is not fighting against relegation, but is begging to be thrown out of this league.” Such has been the disintegration of the team’s status and confidence that one wonders already if, once gone, they will get stuck outside the Bundesliga bubble like rivals Hamburg. Has Milot Rashica, one of their brightest hopes but who wasn’t even considered on form enough to be used off the bench on Saturday, enough residual value to be sold and finance a squad rebuild? That the 41-year-old Claudio Pizarro was thrown on to try and turn things around made it feel as if escape could only happen in a fairytale. The current reality, sadly, is too grisly to bear. • Borussia Dortmund made sure of second place, evacuating the keenly-felt disappointment of the shambolic midweek defeat to Mainz with a win at Leipzig, which was the upshot of a polished display. Erling Haaland scored twice while Chelsea-bound Timo Werner, who received a pre-match presentation to thank him for his efforts, said goodbye to the Red Bull Arena with a quiet display.

With a goal difference nine better than that of Peter Bosz’s side, a point against Hertha should see Gladbach clinch fourth. • Bayern, having won the title in the week, celebrated by beating one of their favourite opponents, Freiburg, with Robert Lewandowski notching another two. As Wolfsburg and Hoffenheim won, Christian Streich saw European qualification drift into the distance for his side. “We have to work on it and improve,” lamented the coach.

Stuttgart’s 6-0 win at Nürnberg means they will, barring a huge final-day turnaround in goal difference, join champions Arminia Bielefeld in the top flight – thanks to a last-ditch winner from Konstantin Kerschbaumer that gave Heidenheim a wildly-celebrated winner, catapulting them over Hamburg and into third, the play-off place. Heidenheim – who travel to Bielefeld – need just to match Hamburg’s result to condemn Der Dino to a third straight season in the second tier. Bayern Munich 3-1 Freiburg, Cologne 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Fortuna Dusseldorf 1-1 Augsburg, Hertha Berlin 2-0 Bayer Leverkusen, Hoffenheim 4-0 Union Berlin, Mainz 3-1 Werder Bremen, Leipzig 0-2 Borussia Dortmund, Paderborn 1-3 Mönchengladbach, Schalke 1-4 Wolfsburg
