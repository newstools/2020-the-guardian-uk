Teenage French climbing prodigy Luce Douady was killed on Sunday when she fell on a footpath in a climbing area in the French Alps, the French Mountain Climbing Federation (FFME) and its club in Chambery said. The 16-year-old reigning world junior champion fell 150m as she and a group of friends were crossing a tricky path equipped with a handrail between two climbing areas. “Luce was a young athlete on the French climbing team, very promising,” the FFME said on its website. “Brilliant in competition.” She was “a lover of all facets of climbing”, the FFME said, expressing the “immense sadness of the climbing community”. Douady was seen as one of the brightest young talents in climbing, a sport which will be introduced to the Olympics in Tokyo next year.
