Summer’s here and, with the UK’s arts venues closed, the time is right for dancing in the street. At least, that’s the spirit in which a new charity video has been made featuring a lineup of Royal Ballet dancers performing to Mick Jagger’s unmistakable rasp. Their accompaniment is not Jagger and Bowie’s famous duet, however, but the Rolling Stones’ recently released new song, Living in a Ghost Town, with its prescient lines: “Life was so beautiful / Then we all got locked down.” The film, entitled Ghost Light, is choreographed by Jagger’s partner, Melanie Hamrick, and Joanna DeFelice. It shows dancers performing on empty streets and outside iconic venues that are closed to the public, including the Royal Ballet’s Covent Garden home, Shakespeare’s Globe, the Apollo theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue and Dublin’s Abbey theatre. The project is designed to raise awareness of Acting for Others, a network of charities providing support for theatre workers. Ghost Light was remotely directed by DeFelice, Hamrick and the Royal Ballet soloist Meaghan Grace Hinkis, who also performs alongside colleagues including Yasmine Naghdi, Anna Rose O’Sullivan and Téo Dubreuil. Last year, Hamrick unveiled a ballet in New York entitled Porte Rouge inspired by and featuring Rolling Stones songs, opening with Sympathy for the Devil. One of modern dance’s classic creations is Rooster, created by Christopher Bruce, which features Not Fade Away, Paint It Black and Little Red Rooster. It was performed by Rambert dance company in 1994 and revived for a popular 20th-anniversary celebration in 2014.
