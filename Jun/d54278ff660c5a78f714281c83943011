A quirky bit of history may be made at this most unusual of Royal Ascots, when the Queen Anne could become the first Group One to be won by trainers holding a shared licence. Paul and Oliver Cole signed up to become joint-trainers as soon as that became possible a fortnight ago and the new partnership is in form, offering real hope for Duke Of Hazzard (1.50). This colt became really progressive when blinkers were fitted in the second half of last season, showing a nifty turn of foot on his way to a pair of Group wins at Goodwood. He looks the overpriced contender in a race short of standout talent. Circus Maximus won on the round course at Ascot last year but the straight mile is a different test and he looks short enough for a horse with a tendency to hang. Terebellum also has a bit to prove against males for the first time and there is little twang in her price either. 1.15 There is a time to oppose hot favourites and a time to accept they may win. This Buckingham Palace offers a huge field but none of them appeals quite like Daarik, a classy looking winner at Newcastle on 6 June. He can get the week off to a flier for John Gosden and Frankie Dettori. At 20-1, Glen Shiel has some chance of a place. 2.25 Also running for Gosden and Dettori, Frankly Darling looks an exciting prospect in the Ribblesdale. Like Daarik, she warmed up with a win on Newcastle’s Tapeta and this daughter of Frankel lengthened impressively in the straight. She can prove herself an Oaks contender.

The market doesn’t want to know Pyledriver, a 20-1 shot at the time of writing, but he showed promise last year and again when second in the Classic Trial at Kempton. He did not get the ideal run through that race and may do better again for this step up in distance. 3.35 Here comes another odds-on favourite with some worrying features. Battaash has run well in this race but has yet to win at Ascot, while his stable has had a low strike-rate since resumption. The most interesting each-way alternative is Kurious, who showed useful speed in her two wins last summer. Perhaps she will prove a Sandown specialist but she is a half-sister to two top-class sprinters and is all potential. 4.10 From the French stable that won last year’s Coronation Stakes, Wasmya has been crying out for this return to a mile and looks another good ride for Dettori. 4.40 It was a huge effort for a three-year-old when Summer Moon was beaten half a length in the Cesarewitch and Mark Johnston’s chestnut, gelded since, looks one to stick with.
