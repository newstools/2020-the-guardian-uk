This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are from Victoria Gallery & Museum, University of Liverpool. The collection is rich in watercolours from the Golden Age together with stand-out oil paintings by JMW Turner, Joseph Wright of Derby and John James Audubon. From the 1960s works were purchased by contemporary artists including Elisabeth Frink, Lucian Freud, Gillian Ayres and Euan Uglow. The collection continues to look forward with recent acquisitions, including an artwork by Fiona Banner. You can see art from Victoria Gallery & Museum, University of Liverpool on Art UK here.
