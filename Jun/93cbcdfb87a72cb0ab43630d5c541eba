Andrew Balding continued his impressive start to the first week of racing since March with a 23-1 double at Kempton Park on Wednesday, including victory in the Group Three Unibet Classic Trial Stakes with Berlin Tango, which prompted bookmakers to introduce the colt into the betting for the Derby on 4 July at around 33-1. Berlin Tango was not entered for the Derby as a yearling and so in any other year, George Strawbridge, his owner, would have needed to find an £85,000 supplementary fee to get him into the Classic. The delayed race at Epsom this year will have a standard six-day entry stage, however, which could make a run in the Derby more appealing. “It’s a big step up in trip but I’ll put that in the mix,” Balding said. “It would have been prohibitive really if you’d had to supplement, but that certainly might make a difference. It’s an unusual year, so it might be worthy of consideration.” Berlin Tango was Balding’s third winner from 10 runners since racing resumed behind closed doors this week, and it may be no coincidence that he has been able to keep his horses ticking over on his own gallops at Kingsclere, a long way from the bustle of Newmarket. “It’s certainly not a disadvantage,” Balding said. “We’ve got fantastic facilities here, which is a big help, and it certainly hasn’t done the horses any harm.” John Gosden took the Listed Snowdrop Fillies’ Stakes, the main supporting race on the card, as Nazeef came with a strong run from two furlongs out to beat Billesdon Brook, the 1,000 Guineas winner in 2018, by three quarters of a length. “We could possibly look at Royal Ascot with her,” said Thady Gosden, representing his father, “but it’s entirely up to Sheikh Hamdan [al Maktoum, her owner]. He’ll decide, but possibly a tilt at something like the [Group Two] Duke Of Cambridge [Stakes].”
