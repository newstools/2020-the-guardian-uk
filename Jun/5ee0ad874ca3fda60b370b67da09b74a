After our six-week countdown – and we realise that was long enough for entire civilisations to shift on their foundations – we’ve completed our list of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles, topped by Pet Shop Boys’ West End Girls. The list was chosen by me (the Guardian’s music editor), deputy music editor Laura Snapes and chief pop critic Alexis Petridis, and is a totally subjective assessment based on our tastes: the songs that we think are the best. There have been thousands of comments responding to the overall list and our individual essays on the Top 20, many of them entertaining, insightful and enjoyably forthright. There was general jubilation for the likes of Kate Bush and Marvin Gaye; the inclusion and placement of Dead or Alive, Lil Nas X and Will Young seemed to provoke the most ire. Whatever your taste, thank you to everyone who voiced their opinions and made it such a brilliantly discursive project. Now that the whole list is done, you get to express your opinions once last time. What is the one song that you really think should have been in the list but was cruelly denied? Post your choice in the form or comments below along with your reasons for why it deserves a Top 100 place. We will publish a selection of the best responses next week. Before you post, please make sure that the song you want to include actually got to No 1 in the UK. There is a comprehensive, accurate list from the Official Charts Company here, and on Wikipedia here. We don’t want to hear about songs that should have got to No 1 – only songs that did. You have until noon on Monday to post your song choice and reasoning. Thanks again to everyone for reading and joining in – I’m off to backcomb what little hair I have left and dance to You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) again.
