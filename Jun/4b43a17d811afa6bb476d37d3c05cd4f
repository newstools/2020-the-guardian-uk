The Conservatives have suspended an activist after she tweeted that a Muslim MP born in Bradford should “go back to Pakistan”. The party said Theodora Dickinson was being investigated on Friday after targeting Labour shadow minister Naz Shah. Dickinson responded to a post showing the Bradford West MP discussing her experience of poverty, saying that if “Naz Shah hates this country so much why doesn’t she go back to Pakistan?!” The Muslim Council of Britain, which has long criticised the Tories’ handling of Islamophobia, described the tweet as “blatant racism”. Shah said: “Over the last few weeks BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) communities have been coming to terms with the racism they have faced over the years. In 2020 to be told to go back to Pakistan highlights the level of racism that still exists in some quarters of society.” Dickinson, who describes herself as a political communications and social media consultant, later apologised. “I fully recognise how offensive it was, which is why I deleted the tweet almost immediately, though of course this does not excuse posting it in the first place,” she added. “I have written to Ms Shah offering an unreserved apology.” The Tories, who have launched an independent inquiry into all forms of prejudice within the party, said Dickinson had been suspended. “Theodora Dickinson has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation,” a party spokeswoman said.
