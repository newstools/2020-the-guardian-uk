If Dominic Raab has “taken the knee” to HM the Queen he must have received the accolade of knighthood (Dominic Raab: taking the knee ‘feels like symbol of subjugation’, 18 June). And since we haven’t heard about it, it must have been in secret. Being sworn of the privy council requires briefly kneeling on two knees to signify loyalty to the country and sovereign, not deference or “subjugation”. “Taking the knee” signifies racial and social solidarity. Sentient kneelers tend to comprehend the distinction. Either the foreign (maybe the clue is in the word these days, as in “foreign body”) secretary doesn’t recognise the nobility and necessity of solidarity, or his ignorance comes from the same abyss as his surprise that Dover is important to trade movements. Perhaps an FA course in “awareness” could help?
