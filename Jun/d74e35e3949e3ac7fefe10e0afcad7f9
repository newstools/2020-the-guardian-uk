I have been concerned for some time that given the known problems with the Windrush compensation scheme – highlighted in exemplary fashion by Amelia Gentleman – very few complaints have reached me, the UK’s national ombudsman. With so few successful claims completed and serious problems being reported by claimants, those who are dissatisfied with the process or outcome of their attempt to get compensation can speak to their MP, who can refer their complaint directly to the ombudsman service. The ombudsman service has a vital role to play in securing fair outcomes for people who have suffered injustice. I welcome the announcement of a cross-government group in an attempt to address the challenges faced by the Windrush generation (Windrush scandal: cross-government group aims to tackle ‘terrible’ treatment, 22 June), and I look forward to liaising with the group to ensure that people are made aware of all possible routes of redress. Rob Behrens Parliamentary and health service ombudsman • Let’s hope that someone from the taskforce set up by the Home Office to help resolve the lack of compensation paid out to the numerous claimants under the Windrush scheme reads Amelia Gentleman’s moving story on the scandalous and inhumane treatment of Anthony Williams (‘I feel targeted’: Windrush victim decries compensation delays as racism, 21 June) by the Home Office. Sadly there must be many more like Anthony. If only one could rely on prominent members of the cabinet to keep up to date on such matters by means of the media. However, judging by the recent track record of Boris Johnson, hearing belatedly of Marcus Rashford’s appeal for the continuation of school meal vouchers throughout the summer holidays, and Dominic Raab’s ignorance of the background to all those taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, one does not hold out much hope.Paul HobbsDorking, Surrey
