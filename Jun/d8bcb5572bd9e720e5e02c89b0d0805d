Madrid’s mayor has said the Spanish capital is in talks about hosting the Champions League final if Uefa decides to move it from Istanbul owing to the coronavirus crisis. This year’s showpiece was scheduled to be played at Istanbul’s Ataturk Stadium on 30 May until the competition was postponed at the last-16 stage in March. “I know arrangements are being made and I want to declare the city hall’s absolute support for this Champions League final being held in Madrid,” the Marca newspaper quoted the city’s mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, as telling the network 13tv. “We have the adequate safety conditions, we have the infrastructure and public services to hold it and it would send a message to the world that, despite all the drama we have lived, Madrid isn’t giving up and is on the rise again.” No official announcement has been made about whether the rearranged final will take place in Turkey. A New York Times report last month said it will not be held in Istanbul and alternative venues were being considered.

The final is likely to be held without spectators, as has been the case with matches in the Bundesliga, which returned last month, and it is hoped it will take place in August. Spain is among the worst affected countries by the coronavirus pandemic, recording more than 27,000 deaths. Madrid had the country’s highest number of deaths and infections but, with the infection rate falling significantly, normal life is slowly resuming.
