A teenager with non-verbal autism who was missing in the Victorian bush for two freezing nights has been found alive. Just under 48 hours after 14-year-old William Callaghan went missing while bushwalking with his family on Mount Disappointment, he was located near the mountain’s summit just before midday on Wednesday. 14-year-old William Callaghan has been reunited with his family after spending two nights alone in dense bush at Mount Disappointment. William was found this afternoon by a lone bushman who knows the area well. pic.twitter.com/11MSgZiuPa He was found by a local bushman, Ben Gibbs, who told reporters he grew up in the area and knew the mountains well. “I was just wandering through the bush, it was quite thick so I was breaking my way through it,” he told Nine news. “He was just about 15 metres from me just standing there, just really angelic, just standing there. I heard that he liked Thomas the Tank [Engine] so I just talked to him about Diesel and Bertie and stuff like that … just to calm him down.” He gave William a pair of socks, chocolate, water and a jacket and the teenager was moved into an emergency services vehicle before being returned to camp where paramedics treated him. After an hour back at the camp he was taken by ambulance to hospital for observation. A volunteer described the mood at the camp as “absolute jubilation”. “We just saw Will. He looks in really good shape! He smiled at everyone as he was lifted out of the car,” she reportedly told News Corp. Gibbs was one of hundreds of people who had searched for William after he became separated from his family when he raced ahead to the Mount Disappointment summit on Monday afternoon. William’s mother Penny Callaghan told reporters on Wednesday: “I am really overwhelmed here. He is well as could be under the circumstances, he is quite calm considering. “I can’t imagine what he’s been feeling and going through. I am just so relieved.” William’s first request was for McDonald’s, Callaghan said, adding: “I think he wanted hot salty food.” She thanked all the searchers for their efforts. “More than anything, thank you everyone. I’m so grateful, you’re all amazing. What an amazing community,” she said. Amazing news!! Missing boy Will Callaghan has been located by a volunteer at Mount Disappointment.

A volunteer found him nr Mt Disappointment just before 1pm. The 14 yo who has non-verbal autism was lost for almost 48 hrs. I hope he gets those TicTacs his mum promised him! #greatnews pic.twitter.com/P2NfzdA7sS The 14-year-old boy was walking to the summit of the hiking spot when he raced ahead of his family and became separated from them around 2.20pm on Monday. Having disappeared wearing only blue trackpants and a hoodie, there were concerns for his wellbeing as overnight temperatures dropped to near freezing. “We’re optimistic at this stage that he will be safe and we’ll find him safe and well today,” Lalor said earlier on Wednesday. “William doesn’t verbalise so if anyone finds him, the best way to communicate with him is to be patient and calm.” She encouraged locals to play the Thomas the Tank Engine theme song and leave water and food such as Vegemite and feta cheese on their verandahs in the hopes William would seek them out. The teenager’s school teachers were also brought in to help, calling out his name in hopes he would approach a friendly, familiar voice. “He has an intellectual disability and he’s very smart in his own way,” Callaghan said before he was found. “I’m feeling positive because he’s quite resilient. He is very skinny. You know, he doesn’t have much padding on him, but he eats all the time, he’s always on the move. He’s very active, so he’s quite fit. “He’s not a great sleeper … As a mum, it’s tough when I’m trying to sleep and he isn’t. But having said that, I would lose so many hours sleep just to have him back with me. He’s such a beautiful person. He wouldn’t harm a fly. He’s very gentle. “I’m not really the praying type, but I’m praying now because I want him home.” More than 500 volunteers, police and emergency services searched for William nonstop while temperatures dropped below zero. Gibbs, who grew up in the area and considers Mount Disappointment his “family mountain”, found William off the main track, a little deeper in the bush than previous searches had covered. Gibbs said William “looked in reasonable health”. “He wasn’t shivering too bad, he didn’t have socks on so I put some socks on him and a jacket. I gave him some chocolate. He ate half the chocolate bar.” Gibbs let William eat and then carried him a bit before he walked out wearing the bushman’s shoes. “I am the one who stumbled across him, but everyone found him,” he said. Gibbs felt like he was on track to finding William before discovering the boy. “This is kind of our family mountain. I’ve been coming up here since I was a boy, so I know it really well,” he said. William was about 1.5km from the staging area – a 10-minute walk off the track in bushland, Acting Inspector Christine Lalor said. “What an amazing result,” she said. William’s shoes were found about 100m away from the main track, fellow volunteer Carla Visona told media after he was found. “I nearly started crying, it was crazy. Just the best feeling and the best outcome,” she said. William was taken to the search staging area about 1pm and police asked searchers not to break out in the usual cheers so as not to scare him. Within the hour, he left in an ambulance to undergo a health check while eating Tic Tacs, with his mother and stepfather Nathan Ezard. That’s when a huge cheer erupted across the search camp. The Victorian police minister, Lisa Neville, praised the emergency services efforts. “Your efforts have been incredible and I speak for all Victorians when I say we are so grateful for your dedication and this amazing outcome,” she said on Twitter. Thank you to our dedicated @VictoriaPolice & @vicsesnews members who searched tirelessly for William Callaghan.Your efforts have been incredible and I speak for all Victorians when I say we are so grateful for your dedication and this amazing outcome. Meanwhile, in New South Wales, a search for a second autistic teenager was called off after he arrived at his school on Wednesday morning, more than 200km away from where he went missing. BREAKING: A 13-year-old boy who went missing in the Port Stephens area has been found safe and well in the Blue Mountains. Thanks to the media and the community for their assistance. Darshan Sigel, 13, was travelling from Sydney to the NSW north coast with his mother when they stopped in a carpark in Heatherbrae near Port Stephens, for a rest. The teenager walked off about 9.15pm and police were called when he failed to return. Local police and dog squads officers did an extensive search of the area, however, it appears that the boy received a lift from a driver back to the Blue Mountains near Sydney. The search was called off when the teenager arrived at his Katoomba school on Wednesday morning. “It seemed to have been born out of an argument with mum about wanting to stop at Heatherbrae in the first instance,” Supt Chad Gillies said. “From what I understand, Darshan was quite keen to get to school today, it was his first day back in a while with all the breaks around Covid … So, he was quite a determined and resourceful young boy and he’s made his way to school.” Gillies said police were keen to speak to the driver they believe gave Sigel a lift to Sydney. “Not that they’ve done anything wrong by any stretch of the imagination. But I think that it’s important for us to understand how he came to get there. And that may fill in a few more bits of the puzzle that can work with health and the family to hopefully prevent this occurring again.”
