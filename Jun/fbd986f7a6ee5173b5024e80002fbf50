Jürgen Klopp has said he feared Liverpool would be denied the opportunity to win the Premier League by the season being declared null and void because of the coronavirus pandemic. Liverpool were 25 points clear of Manchester City when football was suspended on 13 March and only six points short of winning the club’s first league championship since 1990. The pursuit of the title restarts against Everton on Sunday and Klopp admitted there were times during lockdown when he genuinely, and physically, felt Liverpool’s outstanding efforts would be in vain. The Liverpool manager, asked whether he feared the season would be declared null and void, replied: “Honestly, yes. I didn’t think when we went to lockdown: ‘Oh my God, that is our season, we are so close,’ because it was not important in that moment. I became worried in the moment when people started talking about null and void this season because I was like ‘wow’. And I really felt it physically. “That would have been really, really hard. We don’t expect to get it as a present, we didn’t want to have a points-per-game basis, so we were really happy when it was decided we could play again. There were moments when some people brought it [null and void] up from time to time for different reasons but when it was off the table I felt quite relieved. If they had done points per game and we couldn’t have played then we would have been champions but now we aren’t and we have to play for it and that is great, that is how it should be in sports. And now we go for it.” All 90 remaining Premier League games will be shown live, with 31 matches available free to air. Sky will show 25 games on their Freeview platform, Pick (ch11).

We know the situation in the table, we saw City playing, we see all the other teams. We needed a lot of work to come around to where we are this season but we needed luck as well and that’s what we need again. “The next few weeks will be tougher than tough. I hope I can enjoy it as hard work is never a problem for us but we need to make sure we can play the best football we can play. But we will be fine and we will see what we have to celebrate and how we celebrate but these things are only important in the moment when it has finally happened, and not before.”
