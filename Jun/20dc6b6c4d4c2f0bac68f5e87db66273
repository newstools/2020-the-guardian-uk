Premier League clubs will be allowed to make five substitutions for the rest of the season and have nine players on the bench, it was agreed at a shareholdersâ€™ meeting on Thursday. The increase from three permitted changes to five and from seven substitutes to nine was announced by the league in a short statement. The changes have been agreed because of the volume of games due to be played in quick succession after the break forced by the coronavirus pandemic. The Premier League is due to restart on 17 June. Under a temporary law amendment approved by the International Football Association board substitutions will be allowed in a maximum of three in-play slots and at half-time to avoid unnecessary stoppages. It is understood no decision was taken on a framework for how to decide the season if it cannot be completed and that this may be settled only if circumstances demand. There is not expected to be any announcement on fixtures on Thursday, or confirmation of which broadcasters would screen which games, with all 92 matches set to be televised. It is understood the clubs have agreed in principle to the use of neutralvenues where they are necessary - for example if emergency services dictate itor in the event of a localised lockdown which forces a match or matches to berelocated.
