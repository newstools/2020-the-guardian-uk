Beaches, restaurants and even some bars and nightclubs are now open in our most popular holiday destination, as Spain further eases its lockdown. So this week, in anticipation of the days when we Brits can travel more freely, we’d like to hear about your best holiday memories of Spain. It could be music, tapas or wine, historic sites or high sierras – or just the sea and sand so many of us love. Tip about somewhere or something specific, not a general area or city. Use the form below to tell us what made this place so memorable for you, including precise location and website where possible, keeping your tip to around 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 16 June at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip.
