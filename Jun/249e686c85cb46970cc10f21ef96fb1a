The British skateboarder Sky Brown said her helmet saved her life in a fall during training. The 11-year-old, who is targeting the Tokyo Games next year where the sport will make its Olympic debut, was taken to a California hospital by helicopter. Brown, who was reportedly unresponsive on arrival with her father Stewart saying there were fears for her life, fractured her skull but is recovering and has posted a video on social media. “I don’t usually post my falls or talk about them, because I want people to see the fun in what I do, but this was my worst fall and I just want everyone to know that I’m OK,” Brown said. “It’s OK to fall sometimes. I’m just going to get back up and push even harder. I know there’s a lot going on in the world right now and I want everyone to know that whatever we do we’ve got to do it with love and happiness.” I know a lot of people are worried about me, but Don’t worry, I’m Okay. 👌🏼❤️🙏🏻I’m excited to come back even stronger and even tougher. My heart wants to go so hard right now🔥I’m just waiting for my body to catch up 👊🏼Thank you everyone for sending your love, messages and supporting me. I’m sorry to make you worry. I’m gonna be just fine. 💫⚡️✨ #nevergiveup #doitcosyouloveit #iloveskateboarding #skybrown #wegothis A post shared by  Sky Brown (@skybrown) on Jun 1, 2020 at 1:45pm PDT In a message alongside the video, Brown added: “This was my worst fall yet. My helmet and arm saved my life. This will not stop me. I am going for gold in Tokyo 2021. Stay strong. Stay positive.” Brown is hoping to become Britain’s youngest summer Olympian in Tokyo, with the Games postponed until next year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
