Australia and New Zealand are now in a three-horse race to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup after Brazil withdrew their bid. The South American giants announced on Tuesday their withdrawal after it was deemed economic support from government and private entities could not be guaranteed. In a statement, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said economic concerns related to the Covid-19 crisis were a primary factor in the bid being withdrawn. “In view of the exceptional times experienced by the country and the world, CBF understands the cautious position of the Brazilian government, and of other public and private partners, which prevented them from formalising the commitments within the time or in the required manner,” the CBF said. Brazil’s withdrawal means Australia and New Zealand are bidding to host the tournament along with Asian heavyweights Japan and another South American nation, Colombia. The winning bid will be decided by an online meeting of the Fifa council on 25 June. Japan, the 2011 Women’s World Cup winners, are the main rivals to Australia and New Zealand’s bid. The Asian nation’s bid features eight stadiums, many of which are set to host matches for next year’s Olympic football tournaments. Outsiders Colombia, who only formed a women’s league in 2017, are bidding to become the first South American nation to host the Women’s World Cup.
