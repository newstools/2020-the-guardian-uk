We would like to hear from people who have reconnected with an ex during the coronavirus pandemic. Did lockdown give you a chance to reflect on the one that got away? Perhaps watching dramas such as Normal People made you nostalgic for your first love? We’d like to know what motivated you to get back in touch with an ex, and what happened next. Were they pleased to hear from you? Have you become friends, or even given the relationship a second chance? Or do you regret reaching out? Either way, we’d like to hear from you. You can get in touch by filling in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists will be in contact for publication before we publish, so please do leave contact details. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
