She died on Monday, according to her sister and fellow singer, Anita. No cause of death was revealed.

The latter song went on to win a Grammy. After she left the group in 1977, Bonnie signed with Motown and proceeded to have a successful solo career with three albums and the hit Heaven Must Have Sent You. In the years since, she returned to perform with the remaining members of the group and returned with a solo album in 2011.
