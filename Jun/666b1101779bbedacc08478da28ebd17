Doctors treating the two-times CART champion and Paralympic gold medallist Alex Zanardi say the Italian remains stable after a crash on his hand-bike but is at risk of unforeseen complications. The Santa Maria alle Scotte hospital in Siena said on Sunday the longer Zanardi’s vital signs remain stable, the better off he is. But the update warned that his neurological condition is still grave and that doctors cannot “exclude the possibility of adverse events”. Zanardi, who lost both of his legs in a crash while CART racing in 2001, has been in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator since he crashed his hand-bike into a lorry near the Tuscan town of Pienza during a relay race Friday. Doctors say he suffered serious facial and cranial trauma and have warned of possible brain damage. The 53-year-old Zanardi won the CART championship in 1997 and 1998 and took 15 wins in the series, either side of stints in Formula One. In 2001 he had a horrific accident during a race in Germany and both of his legs were severed. It was the weekend after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. During his recovery, Zanardi designed his own prosthetics and learned to walk again. He then turned his attention to hand cycling and developed into one of the most accomplished racers in the world. He won four gold medals and two silvers at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics, competed in the New York City Marathon and set an Ironman record in his class.
