1) Claude Lelouch’s 1976 single-take short C’etait un rendez-vous is a speed-freak favourite, chronicling a pigeon-scattering, traffic-light ignoring dawn drive through Paris. Lelouch has returned behind the camera for a new version, with less mystique, F1 driver Charles Leclerc at the wheel, Ferrari, face coverings, elbow bumps and even Albert II, Prince of Monaco, on board. Stick with the classic, we reckon. Here’s Alex Roy’s detailed tour of the original route. 2) An eye-popping 25 [TWENTY-FIVE – Classic YouTube vidiprinter] years ago this day, the world witnessed Jonah Lomu v Mike Catt (W/O), live from Cape Town. To his immense credit, Catt himself speaks philosophically on the incident: “I’m thinking: yeah, there’s gonna be a bit of a train smash here …” But Lomu was of course much more than that one try: put your feet up for the next six minutes and enjoy the brilliant All Black’s World Cup try treasure trove in full. 3) That same day in 1995, Norway ruled the women’s football world and became the first champions from Europe after a 2-0 victory over Germany in Sweden. Two goals in four minutes – Hege Riise threading the needle to find the corner and a bundled Marianne Pettersen effort – proved the difference. Fifa’s short film on the tournament delightfully evokes the women’s game’s pre-primetime era. 4) But a quarter of a century is nothing: it’s 60 years today since Arnold Palmer’s sensational comeback at the US Open – he went into the final round seven strokes off the lead, but tore up Cherry Hills with a brilliant round of 65 to finish two clear of then-amateur Jack Nicklaus. Here Palmer looks back on the route to his third major. 5) Saïd Benrahma spins, Klopp quips and Clauss clips as football’s return continues apace. 🧙‍♂️ He's back#BrentfordFC pic.twitter.com/KYsJMmmL6Y 6) Christian Taylor turns 30 today, and remains the man most likely to trouble Jonathan Edwards’s 25-year-old triple jump world record of 18.29m. Here are the brilliant American’s three world titles. Another birthday boy: Moeen Ali, purveyor of this brilliant 102 off 57 at Bristol three summers ago, turns 33. 1) Kamui Kobayashi, with clear track ahead of him, eviscerates the Le Mans lap record for Toyota in 2017. More speed thrills at Spa, from Neel Jani in an unrestricted Porsche 919 Evo LMP car. 2) Aces on par-fours. Yes!
