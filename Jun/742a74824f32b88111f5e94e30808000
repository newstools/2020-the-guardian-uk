‘What are you most looking forward to about going home?” Andrew Burnham, a Covid-19 patient at University hospital in Coventry, is asked. “Just getting out of the hospital,” the 65-year-old says abruptly. “We’re not that bad are we?” quips one of the nearby nurses. “No, I’m just going stir crazy,” he says. “I haven’t seen my family for 10 weeks. It’s going to be quite incredible. I don’t know if I can give them a big hug straight away – I might have to keep 2 metres away. But if I can, oh I will.” Burnham spent six of the past 10 weeks in intensive care and has required extensive physiotherapy to rehabilitate his body. Today, he’s finally going home. Dr Vjeran Cajic, a consultant in infectious diseases, says: “The success rate of patients treated in ITU [intensive care] for Covid is not more than 50%. Without support for his breathing, Mr Burnham would definitely have died. But we’re not surprised [he’s going home]. As doctors, we provide treatment when we feel there’s a chance we will be successful, so any good outcome is a reason to be happy, not surprised.” Though visibly drained and still short of breath, Burnham is thankful to the NHS. “I appreciate an awful lot of people put an awful lot of effort into keeping us going,” he says. As he is wheeled out of the ward by an ambulance crew, the corridor is lined with well-wishers: the people who saved his life are clapping him out. ____________________ Since the start of the pandemic, 537 patients have been discharged from University hospital, which is part of the UHCW trust, and the hospital now has only six patients with Covid-19; to date, 248 patients have died from, or with, coronavirus. Molly Phillis, 84, and her husband, John, 83, were discharged from University hospital last month. The couple, who have been together for 63 years, were admitted days apart and kept on separate wards. John and Molly Phillis, who were treated in hospital for Covid-19, have been together for 63 years. “Molly went out on a stretcher and then I was left at home alone,” John says. “I wasn’t well, I couldn’t phone her, I couldn’t talk to her, I couldn’t check. Then I went downhill and called an ambulance for myself. “We didn’t see each other for 17 days. I was only about 90ft away from her in the neighbouring ward but we couldn’t even shout or write a note to one another because of the risk of contamination. I didn’t know what was happening to Molly, it was awful.” Early on, Molly was asked to consider what kind of end-of-life care she might prefer. She declined the doctor’s proposals for resuscitation. Luckily, she made a full recovery and Molly and John are now back at home together. “If you get taken into a ward and you’ve got pneumonia, the staff know exactly how to treat you; if you go in with a broken leg, they can fix it,” says John. “But with this, all they can do is make you comfortable. They are in the dark as much as we are. And that’s why you’ve got to admire them so much. They were absolutely brilliant. “When Molly came home, life changed. We still had to isolate in our apartment for another 14 days but it didn’t matter. We could talk, we could hold each other, we felt better immediately when we saw each other.” ____________________ Dawn Annette Baker, 52, was in the same ward as Molly. While delighted to be home, she is still living with the legacy of the infection. “After two weeks in hospital, most of my muscle mass had gone, so my daughter had to help me get into the shower because I was too shaky. Even just making a cup of coffee was difficult,” she says. “I’m left with damage because I get out of breath constantly and my asthma is really bad now, whereas it was totally under control beforehand. My peak flow is lower than it should be, but I have to manage that.” Dawn Annette Baker, who spent two weeks in hospital with Covid-19. She says the impact of her illness is ongoing. Baker says of her time in hospital: “I think [the severity of the situation] only hit me on the second day when they said there were no visitors. I started thinking to myself: have I seen my kids for the last time? I haven’t been able to say what I needed to say.” After two weeks in hospital, she surprised her children when she returned home on 8 April. She later had a second bout of coronavirus-like symptoms, but opted to self-isolate instead of returning to the hospital. “My kids are my world. We’re such a close knit family. I’ve never gone two weeks without seeing them before. [This experience has taught me] to not take anything for granted. If I could go back [to the hospital] and help, I’d do it tomorrow, just to take a little bit of pressure away from the staff.” ____________________ Not everyone is fortunate enough to be reunited with their family. Even in their final hours, patients with Covid-19 must be strictly isolated from loved ones. Erica Young, whose mother Vicky Cornwell died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. Cornwell was a social worker and lay preacher. Mum used to enjoy fell-walking and pot-holing. She loved gardening and she loved to travel. The example she set, that my sister and I both followed, is of a woman who could balance family life and a significant, demanding career. She was a fantastic woman.' Erica Young’s mother, Vicky Cornwell, contracted Covid-19 in her care home and died in hospital. The experience was heartbreaking for Young, but she says she is grateful that her mother was so tenderly cared for by everyone in the NHS. “When Mum was moved to hospital there was no opportunity to speak; it was a case of asking whoever answered the phone how she was, passing on my love and the love of the family, but there was no more that that could be done,” she says. “It was heartbreaking to be allowed to see her only when she was dead and not when she was still alive, when she would have known I was there.” When Young visited her mother’s body, she had to wear full PPE (personal protective equipment). “I was still thinking they had rung the wrong daughter, that somebody else’s mum had died, not mine. But it was mine. “I said to them, ‘What can I and can’t I do when I go in?’ They said, ‘You can hold her hand but you can’t kiss her.’ So I had a chat and I held her hand. I’m glad I saw her – it gave me a chance to say goodbye.” Only six mourners could attend the funeral because of local lockdown restrictions. ____________________ And yet, even amid the sadness of her family’s loss, Young sees reasons to be positive. In particular, she was reassured by the knowledge that hospital chaplains were visiting Cornwell in ITU. “They made an awful situation more bearable,” Young says. “My family owe them a huge debt.” Having granted permission for a BBC camera crew to film one such conversation, the family were able to watch footage of Cornwell discussing her life and role as a lay preacher. Young says: “I could see that it was Mum, even though they had blurred out her face, and you could see she was nodding and she was engaged. That was really, really reassuring and comforting because it was probably the last significant conversation of her life.” Rev Simon Betteridge, who offers comfort and guidance to patients and staff at the hospital. Rev Simon Betteridge, the chaplain who counselled Cornwell that day, says: “There is a privilege in people accepting you within their story for a short time, and you providing them with a degree of firm ground. We don’t necessarily come up with any clever words or prayers or anything. It’s about listening, really. The language we often use to describe our role is that we’re ‘standing in the gap’.” Elsewhere in the hospital, technology provides a bridge to loved ones. Through the UHCW charity, University hospital has sourced dozens of iPads, which are being used for patient-to-family video calls. Heather Healey, a “query Covid” patient, was able to call her 13-year-old son, James, from her bed. “When you interact online and you can see somebody’s face, you can see the love in their eyes,” she says. “I could see his and he could see mine as well. That meant everything to me.” Heather Healey is shown how to make a video call to her son, James, using one of the hospital’s iPads. ____________________ Mark and Kathy Anders believe the NHS has reaffirmed its value to the British public. Mark, who works locally as a paramedic, was taken to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms in early April while Kathy, who experienced milder symptoms, remained at their home in Rugby. Mark says: “To see it from the other side when you’re poorly is amazing. From A&E and into ward 12, they were constantly watching me through the window, constantly taking my obs’ [medical observations such as blood pressure]. They couldn’t do enough for me. They’re all fantastic.” Kathy says: “We’ve both always known that the NHS is invaluable but until you’re in a position to need it yourself you don’t quite appreciate it. Kathy and Mark Anders. Mark, who is a local paramedic, spent a week in hospital with Covid-19 before making a full recovery. “I’ve really suffered with anxiety through all of this. It’s probably the worst experience we’ve been through together in 18 and a half years. “But the support from Mark’s colleagues was absolutely amazing – I get emotional just thinking about it. They knew I was poorly and I was on my own, so two of his colleagues came to check me out. They gowned up and masked up. To me that was like a lifeline.” After more than a month’s rest, Mark recently returned to work on the frontline. ____________________ Roger Townsend, a clinical lead in ITU, acknowledges the trauma faced by staff working throughout the NHS and is especially sympathetic to those drafted into ITU from other roles. “There were a lot of tears from everybody from time to time,” he says. “In the run-up to the Easter weekend, we were admitting to intensive care on average four patients per day with Covid-19. Over the last week we have admitted two patients with Covid-19. So, two in a week, versus four patients per day – that’s a huge difference. “I think we’ve come through the test – I’m not sure ever we’ll be the same again.” Townsend smiles as he reflects on the lives he and his colleagues have saved. “We’ve had vast outpourings of gratitude from everybody. Stuff is just delivered with notes from, you know, the Johnson family. A box of food and things like that. “Some people will come back to say thank you in person but most people don’t actually remember being in ITU. And do you know what – if people forget us, that’s fine. They are alive, they’ve got more things to think about.” Roger Townsend, a clinical lead in ITU, in discussion with a colleague. ____________________ John and Molly Phillis are feeling upbeat as they consider the future. Forget the new car and the cruises they had booked – right now they are simply looking forward to an exercise class on their balcony. The session is hosted by a local gym instructor who stands on the ground floor and uses a megaphone to direct the participants. It has become a popular communal activity, with residents throughout the apartment block taking part. Asked what the crisis has taught him, John says: “Togetherness, and to trust our neighbours and friends more. Although we are still apart, we’re all together in this.” Young says the NHS must be protected for future generations: “It’s easy to complain about the NHS and about waiting times. But the NHS is a fundamental part of the UK and how we do things – healthcare for everyone when they need it, regardless of whether they have money or not. “I really hope the warm words that have been spoken by everyone in the last couple of months don’t just fade away with the memory of Covid-19.” John and Molly Phillis holding hands.
