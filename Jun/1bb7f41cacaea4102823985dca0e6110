This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are thanks to the Queen’s House, Greenwich. One of the first buildings in the UK to be constructed in the Palladian style, it has long been an important site for women’s history. Today this London building is home to the National Maritime Museum, spanning old master paintings to contemporary installations. You can see art from the National Maritime Museum on Art UK here.
