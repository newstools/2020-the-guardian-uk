Marina Hyde (16 June) asks how many Gavin Williamsons do you need to approach the value of a Marcus Rashford? This is problematic given that Williamson is a negative and Rashford is a positive. This means the larger the number of Williamsons, the further they are from a Rashford. The smallest part of Williamson would be closer: presumably his conscience.Jon HollandGrimsby • Margie Mitchell (Letters, 17 June) asks why she was told as a child to say “Good morning, Mr Magpie, how’s your wife?” when she saw a solitary magpie. This relates to the magpie counting rhyme “One for sorrow, two for joy…” Mentioning the wife implies two magpies.Lindy HardcastleGroby, Leicestershire • Folklore advises that we address magpies respectfully. Being both black and white, they symbolise the ability to pass between the world of the archetypes (the gods, the dead and the magical) and the world of the living. They are the messengers of Hermes. Greeting them politely aims to avert bad news. The folk rhyme “One for sorrow…” reflects this.Judith RoeGlastonbury • “Arrivees” have arrived in the Guardian (Coronavirus travel restrictions, 16 June), presumably to keep all the returnees, escapees and retirees company. Perhaps more journalists could become readees of the Guardian style guide, which counsels against such usage?Michael WoodgateBristol • You report that Diego the giant tortoise has saved his species single-handedly (Diego the tortoise, father to hundreds and saviour of his species, finally retires, 16 June). Was he furnished with appropriate magazines?Jude AndersonCardiff
