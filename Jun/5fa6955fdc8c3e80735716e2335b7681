The 2021 Brit awards have been postponed from February until 11 May. Amid the ongoing threat of coronavirus, the biggest awards ceremony in the UK music industry is keen to run as normal, with star guests and a full show to a live audience at London’s O2 Arena. “We want to make sure that the Brits delivers the outstanding production levels, superstar performances and live excitement that make it the biggest night in music,” said chief executive Geoff Taylor. The eligibility period for the awards will also be amended. The postponement comes a week after the Golden Globes were pushed back from their usual spot in January to 28 February. This was the date the Oscars were originally planned for, but they have also been moved, to 25 April. The Grammy awards have not yet been postponed and are still scheduled for 31 January.
