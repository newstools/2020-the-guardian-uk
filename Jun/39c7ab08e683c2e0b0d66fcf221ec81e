Barcelona and Juventus have agreed a swap deal for the midfielders Arthur and Miralem Pjanic, with the Serie A champions also paying €10m (£9m). Arthur, the 23-year-old Brazilian, had been reluctant to move, initially wanting to stay at the Camp Nou, but Juventus convinced him. The deal values Pjanic at €60m plus add-ons and Arthur at €70m plus add-ons. Both players have to complete medicals and final details are to be ironed out but Arthur has agreed a deal at Juventus until 2025 while Pjanic has been offered a contract to 2024. Arthur joined Barcelona from Grêmio in the summer of 2018 and has impressed in spells but the Spanish side’s willingness to let him go indicates that the hierarchy do not see him as a long-term solution in midfield. Neither can Pjanic be at the age of 30 but his experience and quality are undoubted. Both clubs are still in the Champions League and any deal would not be concluded before the end of that tournament.
