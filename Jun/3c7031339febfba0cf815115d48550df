Wiley’s 2017 retirement album, Godfather, was so well received that he forgot to retire. He’s made two sequels and a pop album – now shelved – built around last year’s dancehall hit Boasty. Thankfully, this second sequel has nothing of his hilariously Shakespearean beef with Stormzy six months and a lifetime ago, and very little sappy R&B rap. Instead, Richard Cowie MBE plays the ageing grime patriarch and dispenses favour to those following his pioneering path. Which, according to him, is everyone. Sometimes this feels a bit like being lectured in a pub car park on a Friday night. If only Wiley would one day tell us where he’s from, or perhaps touch on the vicissitudes of the music industry! Still, even as he paws at these pet topics over and again, you realise that he rarely dwells on the trappings of success. Like any Don Corleone he wants respect, not just fealty, and clearly cares deeply about grime’s future with or without him. As such, the best bits of this exhausting, endless album are Protect the Empire (“We built this up/ That’s why we must protect it”), letter-to-the-kids Light Work, and the ludicrously exciting Eskimo Dance, young talent (it features 13 MCs) colliding explosively with ancient riddims.
