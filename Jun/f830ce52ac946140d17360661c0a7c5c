Your report’s statement that Finland “fought off two attempted Russian invasions during the second world war” (Finns aghast that Trump could think their country is part of Russia, 19 June) would make more sense if it had been mentioned that Finland was a military ally of Nazi Germany and held a vital sector of the front in the siege of Leningrad. Robin Milner-Gulland Washington, West Sussex • If Banksy wishes to keep out of the limelight for the respray job on the PM’s aircraft (Letters, 22 June), I’m sure Grayson Perry would love the challenge.Peter NiasBradford • As the person who started the bra thread, I’d no idea it would rise to such erudite levels, with Michael Bulley quoting from Victor Hugo (Letters, 22 June).

Karin Koller Leicester • Re the discussion about the French for bra being soutien-gorge, Victor Hugo isn’t the only one to think beyond the throat; French ornithologists refer to the rouge-gorge – known to us as robin redbreast (and it’s a masculine noun, by the way).Gerard HastingsCéret, France • I always thought that the “gorge” in soutien-gorge was the equivalent of “cleavage”. A suitable description for some, if not for me. Frances Worsley Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire
