To answer Karin Koller (Letters, 23 June), the French for bra, soutien-gorge, is masculine because compound words, consisting of a noun preceded by a verbal prefix, are nearly always masculine. The exceptions are when denoting women: for example, garde-malade, a home nurse. Nowadays, décolleté would be a more correct translation of cleavage.Gisèle EarleOxford • Quantum physicists understand bras better than most thanks to Paul Dirac, whose analysis showed that the bra and the ket work together to form a special product, which was named bra-ket (derived from bracket). So the bra is a product of quantum mechanics.Prof Brian JosephsonDepartment of physics, Cambridge University • The English bra comes from brassière, which is feminine, but now means a baby’s sleeved vest. Its older meaning was chemise de femme très ajustée – a tight-fitting garment that could have lifted the breasts. In the 1950s, I remember bra and brassière being used, and my embarrassment at seeing brasserie emblazoned on the outside of a restaurant.Jenny MoirChelmsford, Essex • Karin Koller should not be too worried that the French for cleavage, décolleté, is masculine. Of greater importance is vagin. The Latin word it comes from, vagina, is feminine.Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, France • It surely remains only to say “BRAva!” to Karin Koller.
