Michael Rosen has returned to Twitter, as the former children’s laureate continues to recover from Covid-19, thanking his family for meeting the “terrible strain” with “love and care 24 hours”. Rosen, author of much-loved children’s poems including Chocolate Cake and Don’t, and books including We’re Going on a Bear Hunt, went into intensive care at the end of March, when his family let his followers know he was “very poorly”. He left ICU 47 days later, when his wife, Emma-Louise Williams, told well-wishers that after a long and difficult period, his recovery was continuing on the ward. “He has done so well to get through this but please don’t expect him back here yet,” she wrote on Twitter, where Rosen is known for his energetic commentary on politics, education and language. By 6 June, Williams was reporting that the author had taken his first steps “thanks to the great NHS physios who are keeping him busy”, and now Rosen has resumed tweeting himself. “Emma and family have been on the frontline in this, taking the strain, supporting, fielding the worry, chasing up on things,” he wrote late on Thursday night. “It’s a huge load to bear and to keep going. They’re number one.” He told followers that it had been very tough for his family, “not knowing what might happen, making sure everything that could be done was done”, and that they had “pull[ed him] through, terrible strain met with love and care 24 hours”. His return was greeted with delight by fans and fellow authors, with children’s writer Philip Ardagh telling him: “Sorry to hear that the legs aren’t co-operating at the moment. Adds a whole new dimension to ‘getting back on your feet’. Emma and family do sound pretty amazing. Get well. We miss you.” “She is. They are! Thanks Philip!” responded Rosen, letting another follower know: “Lying in bed 24 hours a day for over 2 months is not good for beards.”
