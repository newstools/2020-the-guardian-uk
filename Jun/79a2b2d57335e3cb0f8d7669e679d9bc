Jadon Sancho has been fined by the German league for getting a haircut in his home, in breach of the country’s restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The 20-year-old forward and his Borussia Dortmund teammate Manuel Akanji were fined after photos emerged of them having a trim in their respective homes, with neither the players nor the hairdresser wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in the pictures. A statement from the German league (DFL) on Friday read: “The DFL has fined Manuel Akanji and Jadon Sancho. The players from Borussia Dortmund had obviously violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing appointments and in particular the medical-organisational concept of the DFL task force. “There is no question that professional footballers also have to have their hair cut. However, this currently has to be done in accordance with the medical-organisational concept.” Sancho’s fine follows a decision by the German football federation (DFB) not to punish him after the England international lifted his Dortmund shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the message ‘Justice For George Floyd’ during the win over Paderborn last weekend.
