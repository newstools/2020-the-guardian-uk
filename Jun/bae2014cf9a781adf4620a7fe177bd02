“What dreadful debut stories are there?” tweets Christophe van Thomas. We have had loads of emails on the subject of Jonathan Woodgate’s gloriously calamitous Real Madrid bow in 2005 so we are going to focus our attention on some other disasters instead. “In the summer of 1996, Garry Flitcroft moved from Manchester City to Blackburn Rovers,” begins Colin Sharples. “In his debut, a home game against Everton, he was sent off after three minutes. He had a bit of a tussle with an Everton player. He was a tall, Scottish, striker. You’ll know who it was.” Emmanuel Frimpong has form when it comes to making his presence felt on debut. He was sent off on his Arsenal bow in 2011 and then, after moaning about the effect a move to Barnsley might have on his ability to “draw girls”, he was booked twice in the first 30 minutes of his debut against Sheffield Wednesday and promptly given his marching orders. He didn’t last long in Yorkshire. A hapless Wayne Bridge was so far off the pace on his West Ham debut in 2011 he was responsible for all of Arsenal’s goals in the 3-0 defeat, including hacking down Theo Walcott to concede a 77th-minute penalty. The most surprising thing was that it took until the 89th minute for him to be replaced. “I saw Jason Crowe set a record on his debut for Arsenal v Birmingham back in 1997,” notes Matt Robb. After just 33 seconds Crowe was sent off by referee Uriah Rennie for a foul on Martin O’Connor. “I think he slid in within five seconds of extra-time kicking off and, after Rennie checked O’Connor was OK, he produced the red card. I hadn’t even realised Arsenal had brought on a sub until I saw his number as he was trudging off.” “How about Glenn Keeley in Everton’s 5-0 defeat by Liverpool in 1982?” offers George Jones. “Keeley only managed half an hour on the pitch after pulling back Kenny Dalglish in the club’s worst-ever derby defeat. He was on-loan from Blackburn and never played again.” Keeley claims a lack of match-fitness and a change to the rules was what did for him: “That year they brought in the professional foul [rule],” he told the Liverpool Echo. I had no knowledge of it because I hadn’t played that season … I honestly expected to get a booking. So when I got sent off it came as a shock to me.” On we go. Who can forget Chris Iwelumo’s miss from three yards minutes after coming on against Norway for his Scotland debut in an important World Cup qualifier in 2008? And spare a thought for the former Burnley goalkeeper Billy O’Rourke, who made his debut away at QPR in October 1979 on Match of the Day. Burnley lost 7–0, and O’Rourke, aged just 19, left the pitch in tears. It could have been worse, mind. Stanley Milton shipped 10 in the second half of his debut in goal for Halifax in January 1934, a 13-0 defeat at Stockport. “What is the lowest score to have never occurred in a professional football match in the UK?” ponders @TheTinBoonie via Twitter. “If we mean qualifying for home and away, the answer is 1-10 and 2-9,” writes Bryn Mills. “There have of course been 10-1 wins (most recently Manchester City v Huddersfield in 1987) and 9-2 wins (Peterhead v Berwick in 2008, most recently). If we are ignoring the home and away elements and just looking for the pair of numbers of goals that have never been recorded: every combination that add up from 0 to 13 goals has been seen. It seems a 14-goal game is the really hard thing to achieve: only Aston Villa 12-2 Accrington in 1892; Manchester City 11-3 Lincoln City in 1895 and Spurs 10-4 Everton in 1958 have seen this. So the answer then is thus all of: 14-0, 13-1, 9-5, 8-6 and 7-7.” Last week we delved into the world of Friday night Football League matches. Now we have the full data, courtesy of the very kind Bryn Mills … “Friday home games by team for the past 60 years, you ask? You’re welcome!” he declares. “Tranmere are indeed top, with Southend third. I’m guessing Stockport played a lot of Friday night matches for the same reason, to entice fans who would head into Manchester on a Saturday.” You can read the full list in the atom below.

It was covered in this column some years ago, complete with quotes from frontman Nigel.” “Did Pelé and Di Stéfano ever play in the same match, either on the same or opposing sides?” asked Alan Sheridan in December 2001. Yes they did, Alan – on the opposite sides of a friendly match between Real Madrid and Santos which took place on 17 June 1959 at the Santiago Bernabéu. At the time Alfredo Di Stéfano, aged 32, was at his peak of his powers having just led Real Madrid to their fourth European Cup in a row. Pelé, meanwhile, was just 18 – although he was already a star after scoring six goals in the World Cup the previous year. In the end experience triumphed over youth as Madrid won 5-3 with goals from Mateos (three), Gento and Puskás. However, Pelé did manage to get on the scoresheet for the Brazilians, along with Pepe and Coutinho. “Real Madrid’s La Liga match against Eibar took place at their training complex because of work being done on the Bernabéu. Have any other competitive matches between professional clubs been played at training grounds?” asks Gregg Bakowski. @TheKnowledge_GU Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying was well known. What was the furthest trip he made by land and/or sea to travel to a European opponent? Either by distance or travel time “When Arsenal and Tottenham face each other in the next few weeks both sides will have a different coach to when they met earlier this season. Four managers in total for the derby in one season. Has this ever happened before in any local derby or classic fixture?” muses Mukhtar Khan. Legendary Dundee United goalie Hamish McAlpine missed two penalties in the same match against Ayr United in the Premier Division in Sep '76. Has this ever happened anywhere else before? Maybe with the likes of Rodrigo Ceni, Rene Higuita, Jose Luis Chilavert, Hans-Jorg Butt etc. “Which teams have scored six goals in a game in all three of the league, FA Cup and League Cup in a single season?” poses quizmaster Philip. During a fallout with Man Utd, George Best played few matches for non leage sife Dunstable Town and scored against Man Utd reserves in 3-2 win, when he was technically United player. Is there anyone else scored against his own team while playing for someone else? “In the 1950s, my father was a photographer on the Sunday Express,” begins Mitch Mitchell. “He took me to one game in 1956, Charlton v Huddersfield. With 20 minutes to go, Charlton were 5-1 down. The game ended with Charlton winning 7-6. Has there ever been another occasion when a team was losing so heavily, but ended up winning in such a short space of time?” Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.
