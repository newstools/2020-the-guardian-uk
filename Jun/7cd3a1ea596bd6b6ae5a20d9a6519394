People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The UK may have to rethink its advice following the significant change of stance by the WHO, which until now has been reluctant to advocate the wearing of masks by the public because of limited evidence that they offer protection. On Thursday, UK ministers announced it would be mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport from 15 June, but these coverings can be simply T-shirts or scarves. The new WHO guidance, announced on Friday, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations. The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers. The UK largely followed the same line until the transport secretary, Grant Schapps, announced on Thursday that face masks on public transport would be compulsory in the UK, with fines for those who disobeyed. This week mass demonstrations have been seen in London and cities around the world against racism and police violence, following the death of George Floyd in the United States.
