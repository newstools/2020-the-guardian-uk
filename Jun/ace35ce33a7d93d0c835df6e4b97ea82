The Science Museum Group includes the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, the National Railway Museum in York, the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, Locomotion in County Durham and the Science Museum in London. It cares for a national collection of 7.3m items, many related to science, technology and medicine. You can see art from the Science Museum Group Collection on Art UK here.
