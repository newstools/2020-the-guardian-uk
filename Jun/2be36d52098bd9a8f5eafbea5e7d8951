David Edgerton was spot-on in identifying a malaise at the heart of our national story (Britain’s persistent racism cannot simply be explained by its imperial history, 24 June). While empire and its legacy have rightly been at the forefront of our national conversation, there has been “a glaring hole where the history of British capitalism and the British capitalist class should be”. The BBC appears to have neglected this theme along with its corollary: a history of our working class. Instead, it treats us to triumphalism and royal gossip. An exception has been David Olusoga’s programmes on black British history. His eye-opening investigation, Britain’s Forgotten Slave Owners, explains how our capitalist class acquired its wealth, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Much of the money that built our stately homes, factories and railways came from our shores. The process of “enclosure” in the 16th to 19th centuries involved throwing ordinary people off the land and into wage-slavery to amass vast fortunes. Many historians have identified this as a foundational moment in the formation of a working-class culture of resistance and of the inequalities that still blight our national unity. But where are the documentaries on this or other themes of working-class history? Since the Brexit vote there has been much hand-wringing about “the left-behinds” and “the voiceless”, but nobody seems to be telling their story. This, more than anything else, may be what is needed to heal the divisions that continue to fester.Dan CarterCambridge
