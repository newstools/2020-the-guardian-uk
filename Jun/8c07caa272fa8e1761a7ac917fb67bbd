Pep Clotet will leave Birmingham at the end of the season. The 43-year-old Spaniard joined the Championship club two years ago as an assistant to Garry Monk before being appointed caretaker manager and then stepping up to the top job in December last year. “It’s been a really difficult decision to take because it’s a privilege to be part of the Blues family but it’s the best step for everyone and it allows the club to continue to move forward with their vision and strategy,” Clotet said. “I’m very grateful to the club, its board and the supporters for placing their faith in me to lead the team this season and to face up to the challenges involved in what’s been a key transition under really demanding circumstances. “It’s now time for us to focus on the remainder of the season and for the club to continue building on these foundations.” Birmingham are 16th in the table and will resume the season away at West Brom. The English Football League has set a return date of 20 June. 📝 Pep Clotet is to leave his position as Head Coach at the season's end.He has decided to step down and the Club has agreed to allow him to explore other coaching opportunities. Pep will depart with our gratitude and very best wishes. The club’s chief executive, Xuandong Ren, said Clotet would continue to have the club’s “full backing” for the remainder of the season. He added: “We are all determined to do everything we can to finish the season strongly and give him the fitting sendoff he deserves.” Birmingham - who are now seeking their sixth manager in three-and-a-half years, following on from Monk, Steve Cotterill, Harry Redknapp, Gianfranco Zola and Gary Rowett - wanted Clotet to stay but he returned to Spain to be with his family during the current crisis and the pandemic is understood to be a factor in his exit.
