Re your report (England and Wales cricket clubs face ‘lost summer’ amid lockdown, 24 June), basketball is a contact sport, played indoors with a ball frequently handled by players. Cricket is played outside, physically distanced, featuring a ball I’ve often not touched for hours on end while loitering at deep square leg. Basketball is allowed post-lockdown, recreational cricket still banned. Am I missing something? Steve Wells Claygate, Surrey • As someone who was, for 14 years, a trustee of the Pells Pool Community Association, and after a career that included seven years as part of a clinical mathematical modelling unit at UCL and ten years specialising in public health statistics, I can only sympathise with Libby Brooks (‘It’s a social lifeline’: swimmers frustrated as UK lidos stay shut, 26 June). I too am completely unable to fathom what part of “the science” is keeping outdoor swimming pools closed.  Meic Goodyear Lewes, East Sussex • As a lifelong Stockport County fan, I can assure Kevin Wilson (Letters, 26 June) that some of us dream of “languishing in League One”. Ian Grieve Steyning, West Sussex • As another lifelong Sunderland fan I agree with Kevin Wilson. It does not help that we have garrulous Magpie neighbours (Richard Gilyead’s letter, also 26 June)! Andrew Bailey Gresford, Wrexham • Might Liverpool supporters have better celebrated their Premier League success at home rather than in the city centre, with the resultant chaos and potential risk to their health?
