What a weekend of football we had in store. Italy were going to host Turkey in Rome in the opening game on Friday night, before matches in Baku, Copenhagen and St Petersburg on Saturday, and then three more games in three more countries on Sunday – including England v Croatia, a repeat of the World Cup semi-final from two years ago. Three days, seven matches, seven countries. Alas, we will have to wait another year for all that. But, with Euro 2020 delayed until 2021, let’s look back at previous tournaments. Which is your favourite? Perhaps you were seduced by France winning on home soil in 1984, Germany triumphing in England in 1996, Greece defying the odds in Portugal in 2004, or Portugal pulling off their own underdog fairytale in France four years ago. Whichever tournament brings back the sweetest memories, we want to hear about it. Were you there? Did your team emerge as champions? Or were you just the perfect age to sit on the sofa and watch it all without feeling guilty about it? We want to hear from football fans from all over Europe – all over the world even.
