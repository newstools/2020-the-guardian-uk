The news that the Rugby Football Union is to review the singing of Sweet Low, Sweet Chariot by some England fans at international matches is welcome (Report, 18 June). Could the RFU also consider the practice of some English supporters dressing up in crusader clothes? If these supporters knew, for example, how the First Crusade slaughtered Christians, Jews and Muslims they may be persuaded to wear something else. Hopefully the English football authorities could do likewise.Derek CarlineManchester • Polly Toynbee’s article (From now, policies must put young people first. Starting with the triple-lock pension, 19 June) about the triple-lock removal made my blood pressure rise so much that I felt I would probably not be around much longer to claim my state pension anyway. So my senior age group caused the constraints of the lockdown. Thanks!Ann EvanderFrinton-on-Sea, Essex • As Susan Lacey-Hatton says, the French for bra, “soutien-gorge”, looks as if it means throat-support (Letters, 19 June), but the word “gorge” can, more rarely, also mean “breasts”. In Les Misérables, Victor Hugo writes “son corsage s’entrouvrit et laissa voir la naissance de sa gorge”, that is, “her blouse fell open a little, revealing the top of her breasts”.Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, France • German tells it like it is: büstenhalter.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire • I do hope that the job of painting the Voyager aircraft will be put out to contract, because my mate down the road could do the work for half the £900,000 price tag (Paint job on Boris Johnson’s plane will cost taxpayer £900,000, 17 June).John MachinLeeds
