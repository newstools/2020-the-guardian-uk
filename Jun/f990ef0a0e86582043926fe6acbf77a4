Magnus Carlsen will compete in the richest ever online tournament this weekend just days after Norway’s world champion surprisingly failed to reach the final in his latest event, the $150,000 Lindores Abbey Rapid. Carlsen is top seed in the $265,000 Champions Showdown, hosted and financed by the St Louis billionaire Rex Sinquefield. Four US grandmasters headed by the world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, and four others will contest a knockout under Clutch Chess rules where the final games of a match count extra. Carlsen’s first-round opponent at 7pm on Saturday is the top US junior Jeffery Xiong. Games are live online and free to watch, with grandmaster and computer commentaries. Despite taking an early 3-0 lead, Carlsen was eliminated in last week’s Lindores Abbey semi-final by his old rival, the US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, who was then himself beaten in the final by the emerging Russian talent Daniil Dubov, 24. The Muscovite overwhelmed the American in an Armageddon tie-break. Dubov is a creative and original player who often plays unfashionable openings. His black repertoire includes the Philidor 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6, the Scandinavian 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Qxd5 3 Nc3 Qd6, and the Nimzovich 1 e4 Nc6 2 d4 d5. Against 1 d4 he sometimes plays 1..d5 1 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 Nf3 Nc6 6 g3 Nf6 7 Bg2 cxd4 8 Nxd4 and now his own patent 8...Bc5, the Dubov Tarrasch. As White, he varies between the solid Catalan 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 and the offbeat Vienna 1 e4 e5 2 Nc3. He has said that he considers himself to be one of the last products of the Soviet chess school, as he learnt his skills from players of the USSR era, who taught him to read chess books and think for himself rather than relying solely on chess databases and engines. Over the board Dubov was World Rapid Champion in 2018, but his classical rating was under 2700. Online chess has really boosted his career. Dubov features as the straight man in a humorous video called How I Became a Cheater created by GM Vlad Tkachiev, which deserves to be better known. Huge audiences watched Lindores Abbey online at its official site and via streaming. More than 75,000 viewed the Carlsen v Nakamura semi-final, and the numbers for the final may have exceeded 100,000. Fide, the global chess body, has stated that there is a 60% chance of resuming the world title candidates, which was aborted after seven of its 14 rounds at Ekaterinburg due to coronavirus, in September. The championship match between Carlsen and the candidates winner will probably be postponed until December 2021. Elsewhere, the obstacles to resuming over-the-board chess are formidable. Social distancing, venue problems, and extra organisational requirements are all obvious deterrents. 3674: 1 Bxe5! (not 1 gxf6? Bxf6 when Black threatens both Rxe6 and bxc4) dxe5 2 g6! (2 d6 bxc4 3 d7 also wins but this is much quicker) hxg6 3 Rh3! with unavoidable mate.
