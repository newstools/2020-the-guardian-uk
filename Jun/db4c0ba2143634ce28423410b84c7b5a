A self-described Ku Klux Klan leader has been charged with assault after driving his car into a group of Black Lives Matter protesters in Virginia. Harry Rogers, who told officers he was president of the Virginia Ku Klux Klan, has been charged with malicious wounding, assault and battery, and destruction of property after the incident in Henrico county, on the outskirts of Richmond. Thousands of people have attended protests in Richmond in recent days, demonstrating against police brutality. They are among nationwide protests against police brutality that have taken place after the killing of George Floyd by a white Minnesota police officer. According to Richmond’s WTVR news channel, police said Rogers had “revved [the] engine” of his pickup truck before driving through a crowd of protesters. One person was treated at the scene. No one was seriously hurt. “The accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,” the Henrico county commonwealth’s attorney, Shannon Taylor, said in a statement. “We are investigating whether hate crimes charges are appropriate.” Shannon added: “While I am grateful that the victim’s injuries do not appear to be serious, an attack on peaceful protesters is heinous and despicable and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.” She said: “Hate has no place here under my watch.”
