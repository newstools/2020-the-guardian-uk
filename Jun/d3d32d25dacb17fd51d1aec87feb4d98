This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London. The museum is a leading authority on the British Army and its impact on society, past and present. It examines the army’s role as protector, aggressor and peacekeeper from the British civil wars to the modern day, and through its collections it preserves and shares stories of ordinary people with extraordinary responsibilities. You can see art from the National Army Museum on Art UK here, and find out more on the museum’s website here.
