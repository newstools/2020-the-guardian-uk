Tony Dunne, one of Manchester United’s European Cup heroes of 1968, has died at the age of 78. The left-back Dunne was part of the side that famously lifted the trophy for the first time after defeating Benfica 4-1 at Wembley. The Republic of Ireland international spent 13 years at Old Trafford, having been signed by Sir Matt Busby for 5,000 in 1960, also winning two First Division titles and an FA Cup. United announced his death on Twitter, declaring him a great of the club. A post read: “One of our greatest-ever full-backs. An integral part of the 1968 European Cup-winning side. A player who made 535 appearances in the red shirt of Manchester United. Our heartfelt condolences go to the loved ones of Tony Dunne. May he rest in peace.” One of our greatest-ever full-backs.

Tony had a glittering career. RIP Tony.” Bolton, with whom Dunne won the Second Division title after leaving Old Trafford, said they were “saddened to learn” of his passing. Only seven players have bettered Dunne’s appearance tally for United, in which he found the net only twice – a reflection of the diligence with which he approached his defensive duties.
