There will be no Wimbledon this year, but we can still have a good debate about tennis. Who, in your view, is the greatest female player of last 50 years? Our writers will be profiling the key candidates this week before our tennis correspondent, Kevin Mitchell, gives his verdict on Saturday. We would love to hear your view on the matter too. A few players could make the case that they are the best of the best. Chris Evert reached 34 singles grand slam finals. Steffi Graf was world No 1 for 377 weeks. Martina Navratilova won a total of 59 grand slam titles. Monica Seles was the French Open champion at 16 and had won eight slams before her 20th birthday. And, of course, Serena Williams has won 23 grand slam singles titles – a record in the Open era. Which of these greats was the greatest – or are we missing someone from our shortlist?
