Many of us have used the lockdown as a chance to develop new skills and hobbies – particularly in the kitchen. If you’ve reached new culinary highs – or lows – during this time, we want to hear about it. Perhaps you’ve mastered a tricky sourdough technique? Or maybe ingredient substitutions have seen favourite cake recipes go dramatically awry? Either way, we’d love to see your creations and hear the recipe for your best bakes – as well as what went wrong with those that didn’t turn out quite as you’d hoped.
