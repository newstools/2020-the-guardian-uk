The Nobel prize-winning campaigner Malala Yousafzai has expressed her “joy and gratitude” after completing her degree at University of Oxford. The 22-year-old shared two pictures of herself covered in confetti on Twitter with the caption: “Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford. “I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.” Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford. I don’t know what’s ahead.

She went on to become the youngest Nobel peace prize winner in 2014. Thousands replied to Yousafzai’s Twitter post, including the author and former Oxford student Philip Pullman, who wrote: “Congratulations!” The Nasa astronaut Anne McClain, who did two masters in the UK – also replied, writing: “Congratulations on your graduation Malala! For so many, higher education is the start of great things. For you, great things preceded it and I can only imagine the even greater ones to follow. The world is lucky to have you on it.”
