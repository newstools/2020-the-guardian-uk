The sweet, fruity notes of Lillet Blanc, the classic French aperitif, really shine here. Once infused with the thyme, it will keep in the fridge for up to three months, so there’s no harm in making a bigger batch, should the mood take you. Serves 1 35ml Lillet Blanc1 small sprig fresh thyme, leaves picked, plus 1 sprig extra, to garnish20ml coconut syrup – Monin makes a good one20ml fresh lemon juice40ml champagne – we use Christian de Montaille, but any light, fresh one will do The day before, infuse the Lillet Blanc. Pour the Lillet into a small container or jar, add the thyme and seal. The next day, strain into a plastic or glass bottle. Pour all the liquids bar the fizz into a shaker, add a couple of ice cubes, then shake for 10 seconds and double-strain into a flute. Top with champagne, garnish with a thyme sprig and serve. • Antonio Del Monte, Loyal Tavern, London SE1
