For the past 10 weeks most of the nation has enthusiastically taken part on Thursdays to clap for our carers. It would seem that last Thursday was regarded as the final one (Clap for our Carers: the very unBritish ritual that united the nation, 28 May). I was moved by the comment of a doctor who said she would stand in silence to remember her colleagues who had died. I would like to suggest that it would be a fitting end if the nation comes together one last time to join with her in silence, to honour all those who have died helping us.Janet IngallLeicester • Susan Treagus’s letter (26 May) struck a very real chord with me, a fellow elderly person enjoying this moment of shared emotion. Now, as lockdown eases, those of us still shielding may well be feeling still more isolated. A brief ritual which expresses that same sense of community would be very welcome.Suzanne BurgeLondon • Perhaps we should continue on Thursday evenings and give a slow handclap for Dominic Cummings?Dr Peter BorrowsAmersham, Buckinghamshire
