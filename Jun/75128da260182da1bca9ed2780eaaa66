I am an outgoing woman in my 30s but I am haunted by despair. I have spent years working through depression caused by childhood trauma (harsh parenting and problems at school) and an abusive relationship with a teacher.

Men are attracted to me but are quickly put off, perhaps by my intensity. I am lucky to have caring friends, but spending time with people leaves me exhausted. I wish I had more money, so I could spend more time on my interests. But even my creative work is steeped in self-criticism and doubt.
