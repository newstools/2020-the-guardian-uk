If the Estadio de la Cerámica had been full, 23,500 people would have risen as one. In their absence, around 200 people did and even the cardboard cut outs felt like standing to applaud. Tuesday evening and, yes, that really was Bruno Soriano pulling on a bright yellow shirt, the only one he had ever worn, and heading towards the edge of the pitch, ready to cross a line he thought he would never cross again. Villarreal manager Javier Calleja embraced him, offering a final word. Vicente Iborra laid a hand on his head. Mario Gaspar gave him back the captain’s armband, pulling it into place like an act of ceremony. And then Bruno went out and played football – for the first time in three years, one month and a day. In the stands Andrés Fernández put his palms together, hard. Samu Chukwueze clapped too, and Alberto Moreno. So did Santi Cazorla, who knew. All the subs applauded, and the directors and the staff, ballboys and security guards included. Even some of the players on the pitch joined in, a momentary pause in the middle of the battle, and all across the country people followed. The clock said 87.03 on 22 June 2020. There wasn’t time for too much, Bruno said, although he managed to get quite a lot in – five passes, four completed, two fouls, one headed clearance and a yellow card – and just being there was what mattered. He hadn’t been since 21 May 2017. The game mattered too: these weren’t throw-away, meaningless minutes. Mind you, no minutes will be now. It was 2-2 between Villarreal and Sevilla, arguably La Liga’s two most impressive sides since the restart. With Europe in play, Sergio Escudero, first, and Munir El Haddadi, next, twice equalised with superb shots after Paco Alcácer and Pau Torres had put the home team ahead and now the visitors pressed for more. “In the final minutes we could have won,” Julen Lopetegui said. “We saw the quality of both teams,” Calleja said. But good though it had been, and much as it left targets within reach and the coaches happy, it wasn’t the game Villarreal’s manager was talking about when when he said it was “the best news all year.” It was the man soon standing there before the TV camera, his eyes stinging and his voice cracking. Alongside, Sevilla captain Ever Banega waited to embrace him. “I don’t really know what to say,” Bruno began, “it’s been so long without playing.” And then he had to stop, before he cried. “Sorry,” he said, lump in his throat tightening, but there was nothing to be sorry about. He could have broken down completely and everyone would have understood; the surprise was that he didn’t. “It’s normal”, the reporter Cristina Bea reassured him. And if he didn’t know what to say, everyone else did: the same thing a small banner stretched across the lower tier said, placed there by the association of supporters’ clubs. “Welcome home”. The first time Bruno joined Villarreal, he didn’t last long. From the tiny town of Artana just 20km away – population: 1994 – he was quiet, reserved and unsure that professional football was really his thing. He got an injury and pretty much gave up playing, headed home, where he started working down the mine with his dad, aged 16. When he eventually started playing again, aged 19, Villarreal returned and there was no turning back. Pushed by Juan Carlos Garrido, the head of the youth system who ended up as first team manager, he progressed. A midfielder of intelligence, positioning and passing, a model of what the club were trying to achieve with players coming through, he made his first team debut in 2006, 14 years ago, and quickly became irreplaceable. ✊ @Eng_Villarreal club captain Bruno Soriano returned to the field this evening after an injury nightmare It had been 3 years, 1 month and 1 day 😱This is the reaction he received from his team mates post match 🙌Inspirational 👏👏 pic.twitter.com/23WNO5ipuJ Valencia came for him, and they weren’t the only ones, but Bruno stayed. He played in the second division and played for Spain, although not as much as he should have done. Going down didn’t mean going elsewhere; instead he got Villarreal back up again, signing a contract to see him through to the end of his career. Humble, very serious, and theirs, he became a hero. The picture on the banner unfurled on Monday night depicted him being thrown into the air, celebrating promotion back to primera. He also took them back to Europe: after promotion Villarreal finished sixth, sixth, fourth, and fifth, clinching the latter European place in a 3-1 win at Valencia on the final day of the 2016-17 season. It was the last time Bruno played. By then, he had been undergoing injections for weeks. There was pain below his knee, something wrong with the patellar ligament. He returned early for preseason, but conservative treatment didn’t work. An operation meant he should be out for three or four months, it was thought, but that number kept rising and targets went unmet. Every step forward was met by a setback. Three times it seemed he was on the verge of a return, but he never did. There was more pain, and not just in his knee: muscles ached, his back hurt, his head weighed heavy. Last summer he travelled to Finland for treatment, one last try, but even that seemed long gone as this season entered the final third. His league appearances over the last decade tell the story: 33, 37, 37, 36, 36, 24, 31, 34, 0, 0. But for the pandemic, this season would have ended on 0 as well. He was 36 and, after 417 games, it was over; his contract expires in six days’ time. It still may not be renewed despite his return, but at least now that final column has a digit in it. On Monday there was a heavy hint that this could be it; that objective achieved, battle won, and aged 36, it might be time to turn away for good. Are those kilometres not put on the clock over the last three years ones that can be clocked up now, he was asked on Cope radio. I don’t think so, he replied, admitting that he had made up his mind but insisting that he had to talk to the club before he said anything. That they fear him walking away almost as soon as he walked back in was reflected in the way teammates serenaded him after the game: “Bruno, stay!” they sang. There will be time to discuss the future; for now, it was enough to enjoy the moment and everything it meant, to celebrate victory. “To return is to win,” runs La Liga’s slogan to mark the return from the pandemic and no one embodies that like Bruno. Football returned after just under 100 days; he returned after more than 1,000. The only pity, he admitted, was not being able to do so with the fans or his family either. His mum watched on TV like everyone else, sad not to be in the stadium. After everything that had happened, the emotion and dark days he thought would never end, he wished they could have been there when at last he was. “Bruno’s ability to overcome is an example to us all,” said the club’s doctor Adolfo Muñoz. “His has been the hardest case I’ve seen psychologically; only a player of Bruno’s mental and physical strength could have coped.” “I’ve tried to get back lots of times and I’m not going to lie: there have been many, many moments when I thought it best not to carry on, because it’s lots of disappointments, one after the other,” Bruno admitted. “You feel like a zombie, wandering aimlessly. It made me sad to watch them play. I’ve missed three years and there was a lot of sadness. There has been frustration, times I was going to throw in the towel. All those times when you try and try and it doesn’t happen. But it’s about carrying on. It’s been very, very hard. I don’t know if there has been a case like mine.” The nearest cases are, well, the nearest. When he returned to action with Villarreal, Santi Cazorla told Bruno he was going to be able to play with him again as a way to support him. Cazorla himself had been out for 636 days and told that he should count himself lucky if he managed to walk around the garden again. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo was out for 267 days with a torn cruciate in 2017, which would have been bad enough but it was his fourth – three in his right knee, one in his left. Both returned and played for Spain again. Cazorla has been among La Liga’s best performers this season, providing or scoring 15 goals; on Monday, Asenjo made two superb saves to keep Villarreal in it. Villarreal 2–2 Sevilla,  Leganés 0–0 Granada,  Levante 0–1 Atlético,  Valladolid 1–1 Getafe,  Barcelona 1–0 Athletic. Thursday night: Alavés-Osasuna, Real Sociedad-Celta, Real Madrid-Mallorca Thursday night: Eibar-Valencia, Betis-Espanyol. “They’re examples of the fact that you can come through it. They saw my suffering up close,” Bruno said. “I don’t know if another club would have treated me as well as Villarreal [and] if it wasn’t for Calleja, this might not have happened.” Villarreal’s manager was emotional: “It’s a human thing: when you live with someone, see how they suffer and have such a bad time and then you watch them come through and get the reward they deserve, it makes you feel good, it’s hope for us all,” he said. At full time on Monday, president Fernando Roig was at the side of the pitch waiting to embrace him. Together, they walked to the TV interview, tears fighting through, and then down the tunnel. As he went through the dressing room door everybody rose as one, standing to applaud Bruno Soriano, a footballer again 1,128 days later.
