Ferran Torres has completed his €27m (£24.5m) move to Manchester City from Valencia after the forward met Txiki Begiristain, the Premier League club’s sporting director, in Barcelona on Tuesday. Leroy Sané’s departure for Bayern Munich caused Pep Guardiola to move for a replacement, with City negotiating a price €18m lower than Valencia’s initial valuation, though there are significant potential add-ons for a 20-year-old who had a year on his contract. Torres met Begiristain to finalise the the move and it was confirmed by City on Tuesday night that he has signed a five-year deal. “I am so happy to be joining City,” Torres said. “Every player wants to be involved in attacking teams and Manchester City are one of the most attacking in world football. “Pep encourages a really open, aggressive style, which I love, and he is a manager with a proven track record of improving players. To have him overseeing my development is a dream. “City have won plenty of trophies in the last 10 years and I hope I can play a role in continuing that success.” In November Torres became Valencia’s youngest player to feature in 50 La Liga games. City are also expected to complete the signing of Nathan Aké in the coming days. Last week Bournemouth accepted a bid of about £40m for the 25-year-old Netherlands international.
