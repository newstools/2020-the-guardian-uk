This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Managed by Renfrewshire Leisure, the museum houses one of the largest art collections in Scotland. The emphasis of the collection is on late 19th- and early20th-century Scottish artists. Recent contemporary acquisitions include work by artists John Byrne, Steven Campbell and Anya Gallaccio. The museum is undergoing redevelopment, and is due to reopen in 2022 or 2023.
