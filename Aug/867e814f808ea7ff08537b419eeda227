With so many of us remaining in the UK for our holiday, taking in the sea air on a coastal walk is bound to be a popular activity this summer. Whether your favourite route takes in wild Atlantic shores or dunes, salt marsh and lagoons, we’d love to hear about it. Share details of the best views, wildlife and plants encountered, as well as any cafes, pubs and restaurants that are open on the route. Give an indication of the length of the route and whether there is any difficult terrain. Please only write about exact UK locations including any useful details of access and website addresses. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
