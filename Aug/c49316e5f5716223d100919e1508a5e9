Residents have confronted law enforcement officers at the scene of a police shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that drew a harsh rebuke from the state’s governor and prompted crowds to take to the streets after a video posted on social media appeared to show officers shoot at a man’s back seven times as he leaned into a vehicle. Kenosha police said one person was left in a serious condition in hospital after a shooting by officers about 5pm on Sunday, as police were responding to a “domestic incident”. Police did not provide details about what led to the shooting or the officers involved, but said the person was transported to a hospital in Milwaukee for treatment. In the video posted on social media that appeared to show the shooting from across a street, three officers could be seen shouting and pointing their weapons at the man, who appeared to be black, as he walked around the front of an SUV parked on the street. As the man opened the driver’s side door and leaned inside, one officer appeared to grab his shirt from behind and then fired into the vehicle. Seven shots could be heard on the video, though it was unclear if more than one officer fired. Following the shooting, social media posts showed neighbours gathering in the surrounding streets and shouting at police. Some could be heard chanting, “No justice, no peace.” Later on Sunday, in a scene that mirrored the months of protests that followed the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black people killed by police, marchers headed to the Kenosha county public safety building, which authorities had mostly blocked off. Protesters marched along lines of cars sounding their horns on their way to the station and eventually made their way to the rear parking lot. A man could be seen breaking the window of a patrol car parked along the street. Some police officers were positioned on the roof of the station as people continued toward the building. Outside the police station, protesters faced off with officers dressed in riot gear and held plastic shields and batons that they occasionally used to push people back. Tony Evers, the governor of Wisconsin, on Sunday night released a statement on Twitter condemning the shooting of a man who “was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight” and whom he identified as Jacob Blake. “While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” Evers said. “We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for black lives in our country … “And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with black Wisconsinites. I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognise the racism in our state and our country for far too long.” Kenosha police referred all questions to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to messages seeking to confirm details of the shooting video. The Kenosha sheriff’s department and Wisconsin state patrol were called to the scene so another law enforcement agency could take over, police said in the news release. Meanwhile, Kenosha County late on Sunday night declared a state of emergency curfew, until 7am. The city of Kenosha is located on Lake Michigan, about 40 miles (64km) south of Milwaukee. A Kenosha police department dispatcher referred calls by the Associated Press to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, the agency that will be investigating the shooting. A message left with DoJ was not immediately returned.
