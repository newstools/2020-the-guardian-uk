A three-year-old girl in Taiwan was caught up in the strings of a kite and lifted high into the air before being rescued unharmed. The unidentified girl was taking part in a kite festival on Sunday in the seaside town of Nanliao when she became entangled in a giant, long-tailed orange kite and was hoisted off the ground by several metres. Video shot at the scene showed her twisting several times above a crowd of adults who struggled to pull the kite back to earth. News reports said the girl was frightened but suffered no physical injuries.
