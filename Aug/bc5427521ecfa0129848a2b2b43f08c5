During lockdown, an ex-girlfriend sent me a WhatsApp message to check if I was OK. When our relationship ended, I decided not to speak to her again. Although it was a mutual breakup, the 10-year relationship itself was volatile. She met someone else while we were still together. Within a year, she repatriated, married and had a child. I am now happily married with two children. At the height of the pandemic, there were nearly 1,000 deaths a day in our respective countries. Perhaps it is only natural that someone would want to reach out. Since our split nine years ago, she has tried to get in touch via social media. Am I callous for continuing to ignore her? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
