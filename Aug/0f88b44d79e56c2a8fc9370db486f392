Where do you wake up? I could be at home in London, working in Paris, visiting the USA or Tokyo. Regardless, I’ll step out the front door and run. I started when I lost a third of my body weight six years ago. Seeing daily life – people still up drinking and smoking, mothers with their children – is the perfect antidote to life in fashion’s ivory tower. Do you work? I sketch designs. On Sunday mornings the world is fresh and untainted. Half-asleep, I put pen to paper: ideas come out unsullied by consciousness. A week later I’ll find most are twaddle. Occasionally, one has magic. Sundays growing up… Were a day of self-expression at boarding school. We could wear our civvies as opposed to uniforms (it was so fabulously ridiculous).

I’ve been going there since 1976, my first year of college. I sit in Derek Jarman’s chair and say hello to him. An afternoon out? To Little Marlow church, where I meet my sister. Our parents are no longer alive, but it’s near where they lived. We pray to whatever gods we believe in. We try to visit once a quarter; a nice comma through the sentence of the year.

If you could be anywhere next Sunday… Friends own a hotel in the California desert with three pools, heated by the San Andreas fault below. I often arrive on Sunday and have the place to myself. The manager, Nancy, and I eat cowboy chow while discussing which marijuana we’ll have for dessert. Dior Hats: from Christian Dior to Stephen Jones, £40, Rizzoli, is out now (stephenjonesmillinery.com)
