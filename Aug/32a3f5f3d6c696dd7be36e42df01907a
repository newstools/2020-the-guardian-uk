A 4.9 magnitude inland earthquake has shaken parts of north Queensland, the second for the region this year. The earthquake occurred about 1pm AEST on Sunday about 100km south of Charters Towers, according to Geoscience Australia. The quake, about 10km deep, has so far caused no damage, with people reporting windows rattling nearly 200km away in Townsville. The region was also hit by a 4.9 magnitude quake off the coast of Bowen in April.
