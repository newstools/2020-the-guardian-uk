Liverpool look set to make their first signing of the transfer window, with Kostas Tsimikas heading to Merseyside for a medical. Jürgen Klopp wants to strengthen specific areas of his Premier League winning squad and the lack of a left-footed backup for Andy Robertson has become a priority. Klopp was keen on a move for Norwich City’s highly -rated left-back Jamal Lewis but a £10m bid was rejected last week. With Liverpool unwilling to meet Norwich’s £20m valuation on what will essentially be a squad player, they have moved for the Olympiakos defender who played at Molineux on Thursday as the Greek side were knocked out of the Europa League by Wolves. Liverpool have agreed an £11.75m fee with the club but personal terms are yet to be finalised with the 24-year-old who has been capped three times by Greece. Liverpool’s move for Tsimikas will frustrate Lewis who was keen on a move to Anfield, following his relegation to the Championship. It will also force Leicester City to look elsewhere with Tsimikas on Brendan Rodgers’s list of replacements for Ben Chilwell should the England left-back move to Chelsea.
