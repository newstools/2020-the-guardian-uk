Super League has suffered a major blow just two weeks in to the competition’s resumption after a number of Hull FC players, who played in Sunday’s fixture with Salford, tested positive for Covid-19. Five Hull players who featured in the game, which they lost 54-18, were subsequently found to have the virus, as well as another who was not involved in their matchday side. Another member of the team who played is having a retest following an inconclusive result. But with the players who featured against Salford inevitably bringing the health of the Red Devils’ men into question due to the close-contact nature of rugby league, both teams have cancelled their respective training sessions this morning. It is increasingly doubtful that their games against Castleford and Catalans respectively will go ahead this weekend. All Super League players undergo testing once a week – with the results publicised on Friday mornings – but the Rugby Football League says it is already analysing Sunday’s game between the two sides to determine how many players from each team have to self-isolate as a result of the test and trace procedures the sport has agreed with Public Health England. The Hull players who have tested positive must quarantine for 10 days, immediately ruling them out of their game this weekend and casting doubt over the immediate future of the competition.
