Persuading cinema customers to enter the building and wear masks is only part of the challenge facing cinemas, and maybe not the greatest one (‘I was outnumbered by the popcorn sellers’: cinema-going around the world in the Covid era, 7 August). Many independent cinemas report that distributors are being less than helpful over providing attractive programmes that might rebuild the cinemagoing habit. Even if big studios are holding back their major releases, there is a vast range of potential material that could tempt audiences to re-enter cinemas. So why aren’t distributors making a serious effort to support their retailers, with an offer of classic or neglected films that cry out to be seen on the big screen? These could easily be made available at a discount, or even free, to cinemas to help restart cinemagoing – every bit as important to the culture of the UK as theatregoing, concerts, opera and ballet. Let’s see a bit of solidarity between producers, distributors and exhibitors. Home viewing is here to stay, but it may soon be too late to save cinemas from extinction.
