Frankie Dettori will feel his time in quarantine has been well earned, as he rode another Group One winner in France on Sunday. The jockey, who has enjoyed a week’s socialising in Deauville since landing last weekend’s Prix Jacques le Marois, added the Prix Morny to his haul aboard the US raider Campanelle, who ran out a comfortable winner. It was a disappointing outcome for the Queen, the owner of Tactical, widely fancied after promising victories at Royal Ascot and in the July Stakes. With Pierre-Charles Boudot aboard for the first time, the colt was squeezed out on leaving the stalls and ran out of room again when needing to make a move at around halfway. He found little thereafter and finished well held in fifth. Campanelle, who displaced Tactical as the favourite in the buildup to the race, was to the fore from an early stage and kept on remorselessly to land the first prize of £101,000. Nando Parrado, a 150-1 winner of the Coventry Stakes when last seen, kept on encouragingly into second place despite looking green. “I’ve had a fantastic week, I’ve really enjoyed it,” Dettori said. “I’ve filled my car with wine, baguettes and cheese and I’m going to travel through the night, get my [Covid-19] test tomorrow and lock myself in the house for a week and reflect on these beautiful weekends I’ve had.” Of Campanelle, he said: “She’s got an amazing, long stride. She coped with this ground but she’s much better on good. I was worried about it but class comes through. “I had no plan. She jumped good. I was in front and she’s quite sensible, she’s able to listen to my commands. When I told her to slow down, she did, and when I asked her to quicken, she quickened. She’s a very, very smart two-year-old.” It was a third win in the Morny for the American trainer Wesley Ward, who also teamed up with Dettori to win it with Lady Aurelia in 2016.

Her fellow Newmarket raider Audarya prevailed at 33-1, only three weeks after scrambling home by a short-head in a handicap at Newcastle. She was a third winner of the Romanet in the space of seven years for her trainer, James Fanshawe, following Ribbons and Speedy Boarding.
