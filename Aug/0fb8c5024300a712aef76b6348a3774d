After a University College London study recently suggested that confidence in understanding coronavirus lockdown restrictions varies greatly across the UK and has dropped significantly since the early days of the measures in March, we thought we’d test you on what you know. The regulations vary across the nations and regions of the UK, and yesterday the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced that a raft of relaxation measures intended in England were to be scrapped. So how many of the changes to the country’s coronavirus guidelines have you taken in? Have a go at our quiz and see… Thank you for doing the quiz, and we hope you found it informative about the different and sometimes inconsistent regulations applying across the whole of the UK. The questions and answer were based on information retrieved on 31 July from the websites of the UK government (1, 2, 3), Scottish government (1, 2), Welsh government (1), Northern Ireland executive (1) and Leicester City Council (1).
