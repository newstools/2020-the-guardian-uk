Paul Pogba will not be sold by Manchester United this summer and talks over a new contract will start soon, according to the France midfielder’s agent, Mino Raiola. The World Cup winner endured a difficult 2019-20 season due to injury butended it strongly as he helped Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side to a third-place finish in the Premier League. Raiola said United will not accept bids for the player this summer, telling Sky Sports Italy: “Pogba is a key player for Man United. They’ve an important project and he’s 100% included. Man United will not accept any bid to sell Pogba. We’re going to speak about a new contract soon, no stress …” Pogba, whose current deal runs until next summer, last month revealed his desire to win more trophies at Old Trafford. United have since been beaten in the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the Europa League, but are back in the Champions League next season thanks to their impressive form following the resumption of the Premier League. Pogba won the 2016-17 Europa League and League Cup in his first season after returning to United from Juventus but the club have won nothing since.
