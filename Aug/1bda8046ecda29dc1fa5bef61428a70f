Given the repeated denials by Dominic Cummings and the PM’s assurances over the evidence he has seen (Two stories, different witnesses. So where was Dominic Cummings on 19 April?, 7 August), I think it’s time to stop arguing and just accept that Cummings’ phone was indeed in London that day.Ray FisherHuddersfield, West Yorkshire • Kae Tempest has adopted the non-gendered pronouns they and them (Kate Tempest announces they are non-binary, changes name to Kae, 6 August). Kae may not be either male or female, but is not more than one person. For a more pleasing grammatical concinnity, it should be “they is”, not “they are”.Neil FergusonVaillac, France • I am concerned about the effect of working from home on Noel and Pauline Hodson of Oxford, whose separate letters you published (6 August). Are they thinking as one, dreaming the same dream etc? Or just not talking to each other?Pete RosserWakefield, West Yorkshire • Newspapers are delivered to my small village and left in a box for residents to collect from. When a neighbour saw me picking up the Guardian, she said “Oh, you’re one of those” (Letters, 7 August).Jenny HaynesHorkstow, North Lincolnshire • As a preschool child in the 1950s, I was taught to read at home with the Manchester Guardian, as it then was. I’ve been reading it ever since.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire • Another mixed message from the government: when I signed up for a speed awareness course recently, I found that at present it can only be done using Zoom.Peter BevingtonLeeds • I bet Michael Portillo owns several pairs of velveteen breeches (Letters, 6 August).Mike KeddieDewsbury, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
