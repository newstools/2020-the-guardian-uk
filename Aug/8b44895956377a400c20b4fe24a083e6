We have but one life to live on this earth, but Bryson DeChambeau is dead-set on making the most of it. The muscle-bound 26-year-old American golfer, a fitness freak who has made headlines for bulking up considerably while locked down amid the coronavirus pandemic, revealed a master plan to carry on into the 22nd century in a magazine interview published on Friday. “I’m always trying to add more value to my life in general. I mean, my goal is to live to 130 or 140,” DeChambeau told GQ magazine. “I really think that’s possible now with today’s technology. I think somebody’s going to do it in the next 30 or 40 years.” “I always questioned everything,” he said. “I didn’t have a lot of resources when I was young. I couldn’t go down all these roads with these questions that I asked at an early age. But now that I’ve been able to have some success, I’ve kinda gotten deep into most of these things and only taken what has added value to me.” DeChambeau’s countryman Justin Thomas was among the skeptics on Friday, tweeting: “What in the hell are you even talking about dude?” What in the hell are you even talking about dude @b_dechambeau 😂 https://t.co/3Nx2XDAM7h The eccentric Californian shot a second-round 70 on Friday is tied for 43rd on the overall leaderboard at the World Golf Championships-FedEx St Jude Invitational at TPC Southwind in Memphis.
