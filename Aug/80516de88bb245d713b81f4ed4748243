Larry Elliott rightly states: “Boris Johnson and his ministers cannot be blamed for the arrival of a pandemic” (UK economy: a full recovery from the Covid slump will be slow, 12 August). Nor could Gordon Brown and his ministers be blamed for a global banking crash, yet I seem to remember David Cameron doing just that and winning an election on its back.Ken GamblesKnaresborough, North Yorkshire • “Politicians are not born, they are excreted” (Letters, 12 August). Absolutely right, but Cicero’s words, not Ovid’s.Alec SandisonOttery St Mary, Devon • If sleeping mats and slowly-deflating air beds have lost their charm (Take frozen curry, buy a blackout tent: 16 expert tips for the perfect camping trip, 13 August), we have found luxury in the form of the padded fishing bed-chair.
