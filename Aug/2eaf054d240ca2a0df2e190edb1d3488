There is speculation that France may be removed from the UK’s travel corridor list as the number of Covid cases have risen sharply in recent days. UK ministers are said to be monitoring the situation closely and a decision is expected towards the end of the week. Rising case numbers in Greece, Netherlands and Malta could also jeopardise their status this summer. France is the second most popular holiday destination for Britons and though holiday makers have been urged not to change plans amid speculation, there are concerns for some about how they will be affected if the country is removed from the Department of Transport’s safety list at short notice. Removal from the list will mean people returning from France would need to self-isolate for 14 days. We’d like to hear from UK holiday makers who are thinking about changing plans because of the growing uncertainty over the status of France, and other destinations, on the UK’s travel corridor safety list.
