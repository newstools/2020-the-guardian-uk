This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions come from Royal Holloway, University of London, which was formed in 1985 with the merger of Royal Holloway and Bedford colleges. At the core of the art holdings are the legacies of two Victorian collectors: the entrepreneur Thomas Holloway and the artist Christiana Herringham. These collections have been enhanced through additional gifts, acquisitions and commissions spanning from the 17th century to the present. You can see art from Royal Holloway on Art UK here.
