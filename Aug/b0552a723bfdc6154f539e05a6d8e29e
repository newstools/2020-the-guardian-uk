It is supposed to symbolise the “brilliance of life,” but among social media users in Japan, the newly unveiled logo for the 2025 World Exposition in the city of Osaka was an unmissable opportunity to poke a fun at the eccentricity of modern art. The cell nucleus design, chosen from a shortlist of five, comprises an imperfect ring made up of a dozen “bouncing red blobs – some with googly eyes – in the approximate shape of the western Japanese city, which will host the Expo for the first time since 1970. The logo was created by a team led by graphic designer Tamotsu Shimada, who said he had set out to create something “that was unique and has impact”. The most immediate impact was felt on Twitter, where users, unable to decide if the image was cute or downright terrifying, posted memes accompanied by a hashtag for the logo’s Japanese name, Inochi no Kagayaki-kun. One user recast the design, selected from almost 6,000 original submissions, as the Osaka Kanjosen, a train line that loops around the city, while another made it the centrepiece of a salad with the help of cherry tomatoes. 万博ロゴの例のアレ、コロシテくんとも言われてるけど、ミニトマトで作ったら生命力すごいから見てwサラダに擬態すれば万博コラボメニューとしていけるのでは🤔#大阪万博のロゴ #いのちの輝きくん pic.twitter.com/Lsx4Y6zQZm One post featured an illustration of a women using the ring of cells as a hair scrunchie; in others it became a pixellated target in a video game and, via a 3D printer, a fastener for a loaf of bread. A “stunned” Shimada said his reimagined chain of DNA had been inspired by the Tower of the Sun designed by “Japan’s Picasso”, Taro Okamoto, that was the symbol of the 1970 Expo. The statue still stands in the event’s commemorative park. “I always wanted to create a powerful and original work, like Taro Okamoto did,” Shimada said said at a news conference after his team’s design was unveiled this week. “I am delighted that our logo will become the face of the Expo.” Spoon & Tamago, a website specialising in Japanese, art, design and culture, was among those who praised Shimada’s work. “The selection, while seemingly odd and has spurred online shock, is an obvious one in our opinion and is a great design that will come to be remembered for ages to come,” it said.
