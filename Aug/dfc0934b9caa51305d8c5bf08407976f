The organisers of Glastonbury festival aim to have the event back in June 2021, Emily Eavis has said. The music festival’s founder, Michael Eavis, had previously said the fate of next year’s event was uncertain. Glastonbury was cancelled this year, on its 50th birthday, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Emily Eavis, who co-organises the festival, tweeted that they were hoping it would return in June – its usual month – and not be pushed back to the autumn. “For those who have been asking, we have no plans to move next year’s Glastonbury to September 2021. We’re still very much aiming for June,” she wrote. “We’ve moved our ticket resale back from October to April, because so few people have asked for a refund (next year’s festival remains sold out), meaning we don’t have enough tickets to resell. “Plus, we’ve extended the free cancellation deadline until the end of January.” Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar were set to headline the Pyramid Stage this year to celebrate the festival’s landmark anniversary. Michael Eavis previously told ITV News West Country they were “moving heaven and earth” to make sure the festival happened in 2021. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen. That’s just wishful thinking,” he said. “The only certainty I think is the year after, 2022, to be perfectly candid, so we might have to wait for two years maybe.”
