This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today our questions are set by the Hunterian, at the University of Glasgow, one of the UK’s leading university museums. Its art collection comprises more than 900 paintings, 40,000 works on paper and an impressive selection of applied and decorative art and sculpture. Important historically because of its origins in William Hunter’s collection, it contains works by Rembrandt, Chardin, Stubbs, and has developed particular strengths in Whistler, Mackintosh and Scottish art, especially the works of the Glasgow Boys and Scottish colourists.You can see art from the Hunterian, University of Glasgow on Art UK here.
