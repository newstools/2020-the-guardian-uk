While many people in countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain have returned to the office, those in the UK have been slower to return to their desks. According to a survey by AlphaWise, only a third of British office workers have returned compared to almost three-quarters of staff in European countries. If you work in the UK or Europe, we would like to hear from workers about how they feel about going back to offices, and how your workplace has changed as a result of the pandemic. We would also like find out how you feel about commuting. How do you feel about going back into an office environment? If you have concerns – what are they? Perhaps you’ve just returned to the office, or have been working throughout and noticed a change. What new measures are being taken to limit the spread of coronavirus?
