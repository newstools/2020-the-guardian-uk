This Missoni AW20 look scores points, because matchy-matchy is not easy to pull off. Avoid opaque finishes and opt for a light wash. Achieve this by using a damp brush for eyeshadow. For lips, go for satin textures. It’s a good idea to add a little something else to the rest of your face, but choose wisely. Eyeliner and mascara provide definition, but full-on blush is overkill – especially if you use the same colour. Matchy-matchy does not mean absolutely everything has to match. 1.

Lancôme Monsieur Big Extreme £22, lancome.co.uk The clue to the purpose of a bronzer, as I have said on many occasions, is not really hidden in its name. So don’t take the word ‘bronzer’ literally – it will lead to a beauty disaster. A good bronzer shouldn’t make you look bronze nor should it take you numerous shades darker. If the final result is the colour of an amber traffic light or jaundice, something has gone very wrong. The point of a bronzer is to give you a natural, sunkissed radiance that looks as if it was acquired on a glorious summer holiday (sans sun damage). It should add warmth – call it ambience lighting for your skin – not intense colour. And definitely not glitter – a face like a disco ball the colour of cornflakes is never a good look. I’m pleased to see the quality of bronzers has improved hugely. Gucci’s range – there are five shades, housed in eau de nil and gold compacts – look so insanely exquisite, they seem rather untouchable. But do use it because it is marvellous. This easy to use talc-free bronzer glides on like a feathery dream, distributing the powder beautifully, lightly and evenly (it smooths out skin tone so well that it is giving my foundation a run for its money). The finish is matt, but thanks to the formulation, which includes moisturising hyaluronic acid and shea butter, it’s not flat. And the colour? Warm, glowy and definitely not bronze.
