Peter Foster has been refused bail after appearing in a Sydney court on 16 fraud charges related to an alleged online scam. Foster was extradited from Queensland by Sydney police officers on Monday night and charged at Mascot police station. The 57-year-old was refused bail and appeared at central local court on Tuesday. Foster has been charged with five counts of publishing false or misleading material to obtain an advantage, 10 counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime with intent to conceal. His lawyer did not apply for bail in court, where it was formally refused by magistrate Robert Williams. New South Wales police allege Foster defrauded a man in Hong Kong of nearly $2m through an online scam. Foster was arrested last week while strolling on a Port Douglas beach. Hours before his arrest, he posted about going on a diet and looking for love on social media. “I am on a quest to lose those 20 kilos before Christmas so I may find a new love to kiss under the mistletoe,” Foster wrote. Foster has been in and out of jail since 1995 for fraud offences including a multimillion dollar weight-loss scam. He sparked turmoil for former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2002 when – acting as a financial adviser – he helped Blair’s wife, Cherie, buy two discounted apartments. Blair denied Foster was her financial adviser or that she attempted to help him beat deportation proceedings.
