Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group has acquired the gym and fitness chain DW Sports in a deal potentially worth up to £44m, but only half of the company’s jobs have been saved. DW Group, founded by the former Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, fell into administration last month, putting 1,700 jobs at risk, and Monday’s deal safeguards 922 of those. Administrators BDO said 43 of the group’s 73 gyms – three not yet reopened – and 31 of its 50 shops had been transferred to Frasers Group. The rest have been closed but some may be reopened by Frasers in due course, said BDO. DW’s Fitness First Clubs have been unaffected by the administration and the subsequent sale. Frasers Group, which also owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Flannels, is to pay an initial cash consideration of £37m. The overall deal, which excludes the DW business names and intellectual property, could be boosted by a further £6.9m, depending on how many of the property lease holdings Frasers Group acquires. The company said it intended to run the gym and fitness business using its Everlast brand, the American boxing kit manufacturer made famous by Muhammad Ali, which the business acquired in 2007 for $168m (£128m).

Underlying pre-tax profits for the group fell by 18% to £117.4m in the year to 26 April. Sales at its core sports business decreased 14.6%, but edged up 0.7% including the contribution from the digital gaming group Game, which is now part of that division. Total group revenues increased from £3.7bn to £3.9bn after a number of acquisitions including Game, Sofa.com and the fashion brand Jack Wills.
