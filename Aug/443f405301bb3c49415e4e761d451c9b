Four years on from the 2016 election, it appears that some of the voters who helped Donald Trump win the White House, may no longer be standing by him in this year’s race. Claudia Luckenbach-Boman, who was a 19-year-old college student in November 2016 said: “If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being.” We would like to hear from other people who used to support Donald Trump but have now changed their minds.
