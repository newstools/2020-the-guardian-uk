A weekly Guide column in which we dissect the influences and interpretations of a work of art We feel the burdens of a long life in this man’s furrowed brow. Like the rings of an ancient tree, his great, greying beard betokens his longevity and experience. The sitter’s gaze speaks of hard-won knowledge, sorrow even, and most of us will recognise it with a jolt. It’s an end-of-the-day feeling that defies the centuries since the painting’s creation in 1632. This is one of several studies of the heads of old men that Rembrandt made while a young gun, honing his craft in his mid-20s. For all the painting’s vivid humanity, it was not a portrait of a known figure but an anonymous model, and intended to suggest a type rather than an individual. In such works the artist finessed his handling of flat, finely layered paint, dramatic lighting and how to capture weighty emotion. A stock of careworn male faces was needed for paintings of saints and sages, yet it’s a highly finished work. These heads, or tronies, didn’t lack for an audience, though unlike commissioned portraits they had to take their chances in the art market. Young Rembrandt, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, to 1 November
