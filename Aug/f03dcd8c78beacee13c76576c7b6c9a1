The complacent (jingoistic is perhaps a better word) celebrations of VJ Day shamefully overlook two matters. First, Japan surrendered after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where tens of thousands were maimed or killed. A matter apparently so trivial as not to merit, so far, a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News. Second, far from restoring, as Boris Johnson claimed, “peace and prosperity to the world” (UK marks 75th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, 15 August), it led to the restoration of colonial rule over millions. In Vietnam, while awaiting the arrival of the French colonialists, the British used Japanese troops to “restore order”, thus paving the way for 30 years of war. In Indonesia, British forces were used to quell those demanding independence from Dutch rule. And in Burma (now Myanmar) there was the forcible reimposition of British colonialism. On 14 August, local TV news for the north-west featured school children “learning” about VJ Day. I feel confident that they were not being taught about these matters.Dr Neil RedfernAshton-under-Lyne, Lancashire
