Tottenham are close to signing Matt Doherty from Wolves, with a deal for the right-back expected to be agreed at £12m plus a potential £5m in add-ons. Doherty’s arrival at Spurs would clear the way for the departure of Serge Aurier, who is wanted by Milan, Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco. Tottenham were keen to secure a replacement for the Ivory Coast international before allowing him to leave with Doherty identified as a preferred target for the head coach, José Mourinho, after his excellent performances for Wolves last season. The Republic of Ireland international has been at Molineux since 2010, when he was signed from Bohemians as a teenager. Having made more than 300 appearances the 28-year-old, who recently changed representation to the super-agent Jorge Mendes, has been part of two promotions with Wolves and excelled in the Europa League campaign last season but was keen to join Tottenham. Aurier has been a regular starter under Mourinho having been signed by his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. It is understood Spurs would like to recoup the £23m they paid for the Ivory Coast player if possible although the Milan sporting director, Fredric Massara, described Aurier as “an excellent player” but insisted he is not a “priority” signing. Spurs have already sold the young right-back Kyle Walker-Peters to Southampton this summer having also completed the signings of Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Joe Hart. Wolves remain in talks with Arsenal about a deal for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who is closing on a £20m move to Molineux. Manchester City have all but signed Diego Rosa, Grêmio’s 17-year-old midfielder. He is expected to be loaned to one of the City Football Group’s European clubs: Girona, a second division Spanish side, and the Belgian First Division B team Lommel.
