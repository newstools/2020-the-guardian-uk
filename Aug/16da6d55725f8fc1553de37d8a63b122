This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Bangor Collections also includes Storiel, an art collection relating mainly to the cultural life of north-west Wales. The works in the collection have been gifted by local people and organisations, or have been acquired with grants. You can see art from Bangor University on Art UK here and Storiel.
