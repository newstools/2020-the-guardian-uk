This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Manchester Art Gallery, which has a 45,000-strong collection spanning six centuries of art, craft and design, fashion and dress, with a particularly rich collection of 19th-century art, including a large number of pre-Raphaelite paintings. You can see art from Manchester Art Gallery on Art UK here. Find out more on the gallery website here.
