The US Naval Special Warfare Command said Sunday it is investigating a video that showed military working dogs attacking a stand-in wearing a Colin Kaepernick jersey during a demonstration at the Navy Seal Museum last year. The video, first posted to Instagram in January 2019, resurfaced on social media on Sunday morning. The caption read: “Colin Kaepernick stand in Josh gets attacked by 5 Navy SEAL dogs for not standing during the National Anthem at a Navy SEAL Museum fundraiser.” https://t.co/c2Rtf9dARW pic.twitter.com/Crgj5r1VtC Naval Special Warfare Command, which oversees the Navy Seals, said in a statement that they learned of the video on Sunday and promised an investigation into the matter. “The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the US Navy,” the statement said. “We are investigating the matter fully, and initial indications are that there were no active duty Navy personnel or equipment involved with this independent organization’s event.” The Navy Seal Museum, located in Fort Pierce, Florida, is a non-profit “dedicated solely to preserving the history of the US Navy Seals and their predecessors,” according to its website. Kaepernick rose to fame as a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, leading them to the Super Bowl during the 2012 season. In 2016, he began to kneel for the national anthem, in protest of racial injustice and police violence in the US. He has been without a team since leaving the 49ers at the end of that season. The 32-year-old has settled a claim that team owners colluded to keep him out of the league due to his political stance. A workout last year in front of NFL scouts did not led to any formal job offers.
