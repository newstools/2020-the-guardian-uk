In the first week of September, in collaboration with one of its sponsors, BT TV, the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast is doing something it has never done before: giving two Football Weekly listeners a chance to guest present a part of the show each that week. Each winner will be substituted on in place of the podcast’s host to guest present the last five minutes of the show. The listener guest hosts will have the opportunity to work with the programme’s producers in advance, to shape their segments and to decide on questions to discuss with the panel. If you think you’ve got what it takes to present Football Weekly, we would like to hear from you. We’d like you to answer the question: If Football Weekly was a football team (from any country or era, professional or amateur), which would it be and why? We will be looking for you to demonstrate your knowledge of the game and the podcast, and for creativity and a sense of humour. This competition closes on 23 August 2020 at 23.59 BST, and is only open to UK residents aged 18 and over. The two winners will feature on the podcast on either 1 or 3 September, and will need to be available on either of the mornings of 31 August or 2 September, when the recordings for those two podcasts will take place. We are currently recording the podcast over the internet, like a Zoom call, so you will need broadband internet, a computer with a microphone and headphones. Winners will be contacted by phone or email on or after 25 August. The selected winners must respond to notification of their win within 24 hours. If a selected winner does not respond within 24 hours of being notified of their win, the winner’s prize may be forfeited. Read the terms and conditions here.
