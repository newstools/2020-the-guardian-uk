The prize fund is much reduced from last year’s £1m, but the Ebor field is as deep and competitive as ever. Fujaira Prince was impressive at Royal Ascot but a 9lb rise could make life difficult. William Haggas’s Pablo Escobarr and Monica Sheriff are much respected too but drawn 20 and 21 respectively, while Willie Mullins’s True Self travelled like the best horse in the race for much of the way 12 months ago. She has not looked in the same form this year, though, so Trueshan is the pick to give Alan King another big prize on the Flat. A Listed winner last time, he has progressed from race-to-race and still has just eight runs in the book. York 1.50 The Royal Hunt Cup form was franked again here on Thursday and Dark Vision, the winner, will be popular here. But don’t overlook Pogo, less than two lengths behind him third there when giving him 5lb. Sandown Park 2.05 New Chapter might be the pick of several lightly-raced three-year-olds off an opening mark of 79, having won a maiden at Ayr last time with any amount in hand. York 2.25 Favorite Moon heads the market after a win over this trip last time but that was on heavy ground and others make more appeal. Kipps, second in the King George V Handicap at the Royal meeting, is among them, but Bodyline, a couple of lengths further back at Ascot, could be better suited to this trip. Sandown 2.40 Enigmatic lived up to his name at Leicester last time with an unexpected return to form. He is still well handicapped on old form, having won off a 3lb higher mark last spring. York 3.00 One Master is a dual Group One winner and sets a high standard but is priced accordingly and Escobar might offer a bit of each-way value at around 10-1. He travelled well for a long way in the Lennox at Goodwood and finished third despite meeting traffic problems. Sandown Park 3.15 Cemhaan was a close fourth in a hot race at Lingfield in June, his handicap debut, and races off the same mark here. York 3.55 Queen’s Course was a comfortable winner at Doncaster last weekend and has enough scope for progress to defy a 9lb rise in the weights. York 4.10 Several of these juveniles are open to plenty of improvement but Ben Macdui sets a fair standard having led Steel Bull until the final half-furlong in the Molecomb at Goodwood.
