Celtic demonstrated their domestic prowess once again by eventually overcoming Motherwell 3-0 at Parkhead. The Hoops were knocked out of the Champions League qualifiers by Ferencvaros on Wednesday night and were again unconvincing before winger James Forrest scored five minutes before the break. The Steelmen had been tenacious and remained so in the second half until Albian Ajeti fired in a second in the 74th minute, just a few minutes after coming on as substitute, with defender Christopher Jullien netting a third in stoppage time to move Celtic within six points of Rangers with two games in hand. Motherwell looked disciplined and organised and it seemed like they would get to the interval with their goal intact but then Forrest struck. Celtic swept up the park and, when the Scotland winger took a Callum McGregor pass at the edge of the box, defender Ricki Lamie stood off and allowed him to bury a shot from 16 yards behind keeper Trevor Carson for his first goal of the season. Jeremie Frimpong came on as Neil Lennon changed to 3-5-2 formation, with Ryan Christie moving back into the centre with Patryk Klimala and Forrest switching to the left. Ajeti replaced Ntcham to partner Klimala with Christie taking over from the Frenchman and, at last, Celtic had two natural strikers up top and it was the unmarked Ajeti, the former West Ham striker, who grabbed Celticâ€™s second when he took a pass from Kristoffer Ajer and hammered a shot from 12 yards past the helpless Carson. Klimala then had a one-on-one with Carson with the keeper saving with his feet before Forrest clipped the top of the bar with a drive and in added time Jullien accepted a pass from Frimpong and rolled his shot past Carson. Elsewhere, a Lewis Ferguson penalty was enough to earn Aberdeen a 1-0 victory over Hibernian at Easter Road.
