Ronny Chieng. I remember when he first broke through, his “teaching my mum how to use technology” bit had me in tears. Key and Peele’s substitute teacher. I still rewatch that sketch a couple times a year – great premise and execution. Infinite Jest. It was a book I read years ago in university. David Foster Wallace draws you in with these well fleshed-out but bizarre characters, and the situations they find themselves in lead to the humour. Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Think I’m a bit late to the party on this one, but only started watching it in February. The writing is so tight! Rush Hour. Well, the whole Rush Hour franchise, really. I loved Jackie Chan growing up, watching mostly his Hong Kong film work. Seeing him in a Hollywood production was amazing. I was doing a show in Malaysia and when I said I was 29, I heard an audible gasp in the room. I said: “Wait what? How old do you think I am?” And some lady yelled out “40!” and got an applause break. Wagamama’s. What a joke of a restaurant. Is it even Asian? I tried perming my hair by myself in lockdown. It came out looking ridiculous – my hair was so damaged and crispy. The number 4. Chinese people think it’s bad luck. But it’s just a number. Smouldering. Nigel Ng is on YouTube at mrnigelng.
