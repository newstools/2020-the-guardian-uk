This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from ANGUSalive, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the county of Angus. The trust offers residents and visitors services to inspire a healthy lifestyle, including sports centres, country parks, theatres and venues, museums, galleries, archives and libraries. ANGUSalive Museums, Galleries and Archives manage the Angus Council Collections. You can see art from ANGUSalive on Art UK here. Find out more on the website here.
