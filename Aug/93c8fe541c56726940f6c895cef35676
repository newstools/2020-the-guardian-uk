China has suspended Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with New Zealand amid a row with western nations protesting against a tough new security law that Beijing imposed on the city. New Zealand had already suspended the treaty from its end, joining western powers including Canada, Britain, Australia and Germany that did likewise after the law was introduced in late June. China hit back by suspending Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with Canada, Britain and Australia, a largely symbolic gesture. “New Zealand’s practices ... grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, announcing Beijing’s decision to suspend any judicial cooperation with Wellington. Critics say the security law will erode civil liberties and human rights enjoyed by residents in the former British colony, which was returned to China in 1997. New Zealand has also tightened restrictions on military and dual-use exports to Hong Kong. Its latest travel advice to New Zealand citizens in the territory said the security law had led to an increased risk of arrest for activities such as protests, with the possibility of being removed to mainland China to face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The US decided to rescind Hong Kong’s special trading privileges after the new law was enacted. With Agence France-Presse
