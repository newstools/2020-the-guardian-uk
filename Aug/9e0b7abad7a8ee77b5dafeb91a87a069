The Criterium du Dauphiné leader Primoz Roglic pulled out of the race’s final stage on Sunday due to injuries. The Slovenian, who rides for Jumbo-Visma, suffered bruises and cuts after crashing during the penultimate stage on Saturday but managed to finish in 10th place, holding on to his lead in the general classification. His withdrawal means the second-placed Thibaut Pinot, who rides for Groupama-FDJ, will move into the lead heading into Sunday’s finale.“As a result of his crash yesterday Primoz Roglic – leader in the general and points classification – won’t start in the ultimate stage today,” Jumbo-Visma announced on Twitter. “The evolution of his injuries will determine the plans for the upcoming races. Speedy recovery.”The 2019 Tour de France winner, Egan Bernal, had pulled out on Saturday, with the French sports daily L’Equipe reporting that the 23-year-old was suffering from back pains. The Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel, meanwhile, spent the night in hospital after he suffered multiple injuries following a crash off a bridge during Saturday’s Il Lombardia. The Deceuninck-QuickStep cyclist hit a bridge wall before he went over into a ravine and while he remained conscious at all times, he was placed into a precautionary neck brace and taken to the Como hospital by ambulance. A statement from his team read: “The X-rays showed a fractured pelvis and a right lung contusion, which will keep Evenepoel – a winner of four stage races this season - on the sidelines for the upcoming period.” Maximilian Schachmann, a rider for BORA-hansgrohe, was also knocked off his bike at Il Lombardia by a driver cutting across his path.
