Manchester United’s Tahith Chong has joined up with Werder Bremen’s pre-season training camp in Austria before a potential loan move to the Bundesliga club. The Netherlands Under-21 forward only signed a new contract at Old Trafford in March, which keeps him at the club until June 2022, with the option to extend the deal by a further year. Chong first moved to England four years ago from Feyenoord and has progressed to the fringe of the first team, but looks set to spend the upcoming campaign in Germany. Werder tweeted: “Although the final terms of his move are yet to be agreed, Tahith Chong has been given permission to train with the club and will therefore join this morning’s session.” Bremen are in Zillerdeich for a pre-season training camp before the new Bundesliga campaign, which is due to begin on September 18. Florian Kohfeldt’s side finished 16th last season and stayed up after a relegation play-off with Heidenheim, surviving only thanks to the away goal rule.
