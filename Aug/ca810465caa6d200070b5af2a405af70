Officials in Danbury, Connecticut, say they will name their sewage plant after the comedian John Oliver, in retaliation for an expletive-filled rant about the city on his HBO show. Mayor Mark Boughton announced the move on his Facebook page. “We are going to rename it the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant,” the Republican mayor said. “Why? Because it’s full of crap just like you, John.” In a recent episode of HBO’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, the British-born comic explored racial disparities in the jury selection process, citing problems in Hartford and New Britain. “If you’re going to forget a town in Connecticut,” he said, “why not forget Danbury? Because, and this is true, fuck Danbury!” Noting Danbury’s “charming railway museum” and its “historic Hearthstone Castle”, he said: “Danbury, Connecticut can eat my whole ass.” Oliver added that he knew “exactly three things about Danbury. USA Today ranked it the second-best city to live in 2015, it was once the center of the American hat industry and if you’re from there, you have a standing invite to come get a thrashing from John Oliver, children included, fuck you.” It wasn’t clear what prompted the outburst. Oliver’s agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2017, Oliver made fun of Boughton and other mayors regarding videos they made seeking to attract Amazon’s second world headquarters. In his video, Boughton asked the home assistant Alexa where the best place for the facility would be, and Alexa said Danbury. In Boughton’s new video, he also mentions that Amazon has decided to open a distribution facility in his city. “And, oh by the way, thanks for showing that Amazon video,” Boughton says. “We did get Amazon here in Danbury.”
