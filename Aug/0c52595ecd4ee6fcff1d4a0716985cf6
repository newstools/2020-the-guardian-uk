I feel so let down by my son. When he went to prison for three years, his girlfriend stuck by him and took care of him. When he came home, he had a new place and job waiting for him. Then she became pregnant and he reacted by becoming more self-centred. Three months later he left her. She was a bit controlling and he says he wants to live alone but I feel so ashamed of his behaviour. This has affected my daily life as he had to move into a house I rent out. The heartbreak I feel for his ex is truly horrible. I cry every day for her and my grandson. I raised my son on my own as his dad did the same thing to me so that makes things even worse. How do I get over my sadness and feelings of disappointment? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
