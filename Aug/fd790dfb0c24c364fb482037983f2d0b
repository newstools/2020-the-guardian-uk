We are concerned that your article (Decolonising dermatology: why black and brown skin need better treatment, 13 August) presents a biased view of the issue, failing to highlight the significant work that has and continues to be done by dermatologists, both in the UK and globally, to address disparities in our speciality. This bias is detrimental as it can undermine confidence in our speciality, with potential consequences for the long-term health and wellbeing of the general population. Western dermatology developed as an independent discipline in Europe from the 18th century. For this reason, for most of the history of dermatology in the west, the reference point of “normality” has been that of Europeans with lightly pigmented skin. Dermatologists have tried to confront this Eurocentric bias via the development of the concept of “ethnic dermatology” and/or “skin of colour dermatology”. These have been used as an umbrella term to forge discussions and research about how our speciality can better encompass and cater for people of different geographical ancestries, with diverse skin tones, with findings disseminated to dermatologists and non-dermatologists via many educational resources and conferences/courses. Thus, contrary to the premise of your article, there are significant dermatological educational resources, including more than 10 textbooks entirely focused on skin rashes in diverse populations and/or skin tones, as well as several online resources on this topic. Many educational events/conferences have also been held by dermatological societies and primary care organisations around the world focused on this topic. While we acknowledge that further work needs to be done to ensure that the diverse spectrum of human phenotypes and genotypes are encompassed in our speciality, it is also important that the tremendous amount of work that has already been done in relation to this issue is not neglected.
