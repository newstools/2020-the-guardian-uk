This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Kirklees Museums & Galleries: Huddersfield Art Gallery. The Kirklees collection consists primarily of British art from the 19th century to the present. The collection includes works by leading British artists including Francis Bacon, LS Lowry, Henry Moore, Frank Auerbach and Stanley Spencer, in addition to a number of works by members of the Camden Town Group. The collection can normally be seen at Huddersfield Art Gallery, which is currently closed for refurbishment.
