Your editorial on the election of Sir Ed Davey as Liberal Democrat leader (27 August) misses a key point. The leaders of the four largest parties in parliament are now all clean-shaven, middle-aged white men in suits. Two have knighthoods. This is what diversity in 2020 at Westminster looks like it seems.Keith FlettTottenham, London • The “Ship’s boiler makers’ riveters’ holder-up” (Letters, 27 August) reminded me of a famous entrant on the 1950s TV show What’s My Line?, where the panel had to guess a person’s occupation. It was generally agreed that the job “Saggar maker’s bottom knocker” was the strangest in the history of the show.Dr Brigid PurcellNorwich • To determine the rank order of cities (Letters, 27 August), we could use the General Post Office’s old dialling system. So London is 01, Birmingham 02, Edinburgh 03, Glasgow 04, Liverpool 05.Val PriorWaterlooville, Hampshire • Regarding city status, down here in Thanet, in the south-east corner of England, the “town” of Birchington-on-Sea insists that it is the largest village in England. Delusions of grandeur all round methinks.David WheatleyMargate, Kent • Back in January we set off for a holiday to Japan. On arrival our guide looked at my passport photo and said: “That isn’t you is it?” (Letters, 25 August). I could have kissed him.Carolyn StottTadworth, Surrey
