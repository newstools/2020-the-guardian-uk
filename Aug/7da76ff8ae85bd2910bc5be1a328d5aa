Rose Lavelle has become the second United States international to sign for Manchester City Women this month, following in the footsteps of Sam Mewis. The midfielder, one of the best in the world, arrives from OL Reign, who only signed her from Washington Spirit on Sunday, knowing that she would immediately go abroad. Lavelle, a World Cup winner in 2019 who has 45 caps for the USWNT, said: “I’m so excited to join Manchester City and I can’t wait to play alongside some really talented players. I’m looking forward to the opportunity of playing in England and competing in the Champions League. “After talking with [head coach] Gareth Taylor about the team and how he saw me fitting in, it seemed like a great environment that would really push and develop me as a player. “I’ve heard amazing things about the club and it just felt like a really good fit overall. I want to challenge myself and feel that Manchester City is the perfect environment to do so and hopefully, I’ll find some success along the way.” Taylor added: “We’re thrilled to have secured Rose’s services – with her impressive back catalogue, she is an incredibly exciting player and one we’re all looking forward to working with. Her endless accolades for both club and country are proof of what a talent she is and she’s exactly the kind of player we want here at City, with her ambitions and desire for success matching our own.” The new Women’s Super League season begins on Sunday, 6 September.
