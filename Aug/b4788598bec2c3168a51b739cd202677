At least 90 people are feared trapped in the debris of a five-storey building that collapsed to the south of India’s financial capital of Mumbai, according to police in Maharashtra state. The building, which contained around 47 flats, caved in on Monday evening, a police statement said. Authorities said 28 people were pulled out by rescue teams amid heavy monsoon rains and local residents had joined the operation at the disaster site in Mahad, an industrial town about 125 miles from Mumbai. The number of dead is not yet known. Local TV channels showed footage of the debris, with locals and police trying to salvage the trapped people. The TV footage also showed at least one ambulance leaving the area as people surrounding it made frantic phone calls. Maharashtra’s chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray, had assured the local administration of all possible support for speedy rescue and relief work, his office said on Twitter.
