Leeds are on the verge of making their first marquee signing since returning to the Premier League after reaching an agreement with Valencia for the transfer of Spain striker Rodrigo. The La Liga club announced on their website on Tuesday evening that a deal in principle has been agreed, for a reported £30m fee. Personal terms and a medical for the player are still to be finalised. The 29-year-old has scored 59 goals in 220 games for Valencia since joining from Benfica in 2014, initially on loan, and would boost Marcelo Bielsa’s attacking options ahead of Leeds’ first season back in the English top flight for 16 years. A statement on Valencia’s official website read: “Valencia CF have reached a preliminary agreement with Leeds United FC this Tuesday for the transfer of Rodrigo Moreno, at the expense of completing all the documentation and other formalities and passing the mandatory medical examination. “Valencia CF want to thank [Rodrigo] for his commitment and effort over the last six seasons,” the statement added. “Valencia wish him all the best in this new stage of his sports career.” Rodrigo is the latest high-profile departure in a turbulent summer for the Spanish club. Earlier this month, winger Ferran Torres joined Manchester City for £24.5m, while midfielders Dani Parejo and Francis Coquelin have joined local rivals Villarreal. So far in this window, Leeds have turned loan spells for Helder Costa and Illan Meslier into permanent deals, and brought Jack Harrison back on another loan from City. The club have also boosted their youth ranks with the captures of Joe Gelhardt, Charlie Allen and Cody Drameh.
