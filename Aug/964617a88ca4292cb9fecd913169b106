Few things are more atmospheric than an ancient stone circle, the overgrown remains of a hill fort, or centuries-old chapel left to return to the wild. The UK is scattered with such ruins, telling tales of the past – and we’d love to hear about a favourite you have discovered. We’re looking for lesser-known suggestions, please. So, tell us about a wild folly, an abandoned castle or remote sacred site – and why (or how) it became special to you. If you have taken a great photograph of it, great, please feel free to send it in – though it is your tip that will be judged for the competition. Please only write about locations in the UK that are free to access and not on private land. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 1 September at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
