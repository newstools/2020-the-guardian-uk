Over the last six months it is interesting just how often the PM has taken personal control after some shambles or another (Boris Johnson moves to seize control of schools agenda after exams chaos, 24 August). But it is more interesting that when the next mess comes along he is somehow no longer responsible.Bill StothartChester • Isn’t it typical of the present spate of non-sequential thinking that Boris Johnson says about our kids going back to school that “The risks are very, very, very small that they’ll even get it, but then the risk that they’ll suffer from it badly are very, very, very, very small indeed”. But isn’t it true that if one of our kids gets it, even if they suffer so little they are virtually asymptomatic, they can still pass it on to the rest of our family, several of whom are at high risk?Jenny BackwellHove • When MPs return to parliament on 1 September, the same day schools return, are we to assume that all 650 will be sitting crowded on the green benches with no social distancing or masks but with thoroughly washed hands to keep them safe? Surely as they all know each other, and exist in a Westminster bubble, they should not be concerned for their health?Dr Lee McKennaRavenshead, Nottinghamshire • So busy school corridors are noisier (Scottish secondary school pupils set to wear face masks in corridors, 24 August)? It would make more sense if teachers changed classrooms rather than pupils, as they do in Germany. Most subjects can be taught anywhere.Victoria PaleitSouthmoor, Oxfordshire • Join the conversation – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
