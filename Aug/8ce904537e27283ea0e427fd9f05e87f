Wilfried Zaha remains determined to leave Crystal Palace, with the Ivory Coast forward prepared to remain patient to secure a move. Zaha has made no secret of his desire to test himself at a higher level and Roy Hodgson admitted in July that the 27-year-old’s form had been affected by the saga about his future. Palace turned down two bids from Everton last summer, and interest from Arsenal ended with the club signing his international teammate Nicolas Pépé after they were put off by an £80m price tag. Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco are reported to have shown an interest in Zaha in this window but Palace have yet to receive an official approach. The player is understood to be relaxed about waiting until the last part of the window in October if necessary to ensure his departure from the club he first joined at the age of 12. Eberechi Eze is set for a Palace medical on Thursday as the England Under-21 forward closes in on a move from Queens Park Rangers for an initial £15m, while the club have also offered a contract to Ryan Fraser after he left Bournemouth and had a bid for Mainz striker Jean-Philippe Mateta rejected. The defender Nathan Ferguson has signed from West Brom but Zaha – who featured in Palace’s first pre-season match against Oxford this week – still has his heart set on leaving for the second time having spent two years at Manchester United after a £10m move in 2013. “If he feels he just does not want to be with us any more, that would be sad,” Hodgson said in July. “We still like him very much; we can’t make him like us. This is a situation that only he and the club can sort out.”
