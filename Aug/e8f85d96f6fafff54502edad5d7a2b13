French prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged rape against a former deputy mayor of Paris after a man accused him of years of abuse. A preliminary investigation against Christophe Girard has been opened into alleged “rape by a person in a position of authority”, the Paris prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, said on Tuesday. The probe was opened swiftly after the New York Times reported the allegations of Aniss Hmaid, now 46, that Girard had sexually abused him over nearly a decade after they met in Tunisia, when Hmaid was 15. Hmaid claimed that Girard had sexually abused him when he was 16 and had then coerced him into sex on about 20 further occasions over several years. Girard, in the New York Times, dismissed the claims as “slander”. The prosecutor said the investigation would aim to determine if the allegations “could be characterised as a crime” and also, given that the alleged events date back several decades, “if the statute of limitations applies to them”. Girard resigned as deputy to the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, in July after opposition politicians and women’s groups demanded his suspension over his ties to Gabriel Matzneff, an award-winning writer who has never hidden his paedophilia. Girard, in a statement issued by his lawyer, Delphine Meillet, on Sunday, rejected Hmaid’s accusations “with the utmost firmness” and threatened to sue for defamation. In the New York Times, he attributed his resignation to “a new McCarthyism and the rise of cancel culture”. Girard, who was in charge of cultural affairs for the Paris government until his resignation, was questioned in March in connection with a continuing investigation into Matzneff after claims by the author Vanessa Springora of an underage relationship with her. Matzneff is to stand trial next year on a charge of justifying paedophilia, and prosecutors launched a rape investigation the day after Springora’s bestselling book Consent was published.
