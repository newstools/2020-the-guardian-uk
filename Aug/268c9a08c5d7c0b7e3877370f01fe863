Organisers of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham are no longer planning to use a single-site athletes’ village. The accommodation facility was set to be built in the Perry Barr area of the city, but the coronavirus pandemic has changed the thinking, with three sites now being used. They will be at the NEC hotel, the University of Warwick and the University of Birmingham. Birmingham 2022’s chief executive Ian Reid said: “These are challenging times for all of us and delivering a major multi-sports event during this period has meant we have needed to collaborate effectively, be pragmatic to change, and remain realistic about the challenges we face. “We recognise that this new model is a move away from the historic norm and we are grateful for the support shown by our partners across the Commonwealth Games Associations. “Birmingham and the West Midlands is extremely fortunate to have superb alternate facilities and we are making this decision now, with two years to go, to de-risk the project, ensure delivery for athletes and teams and secure the legacy of new housing and transport infrastructure in Perry Barr.” The regeneration project in Perry Barr, with new housing and transport infrastructure, will still continue.
