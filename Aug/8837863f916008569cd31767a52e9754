Nail bars, outdoor pools, and beauty salons can reopen in Leicester from Wednesday, but restrictions on gatherings in private homes and gardens will remain in place, Matt Hancock has said. “My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities,” the health and social care secretary said. “The rate of infection has now dropped to a safe enough level to allow further businesses including beauty salons, nail bars and some outdoor venues to reopen in the area. Current restrictions on gatherings must remain in place to further bring down the rate of infection.” The east Midlands city was the first area in the UK to be placed under local lockdown, on 30 June, after its infection rate rose to 135 cases per 100,000 people. This fell to 60 cases per 100,000 in the week 7-13 August. Leicester’s lockdown was partially lifted in July, with schools and nurseries allowed to reopen, and then further in early August, when pubs, bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen their doors. The latest review implements the easing of restrictions introduced nationally on 11 and 13 July, and means nail bars, beauty salons, tanning booths and salons, spas and beauty salons, massage parlours, tattoo parlours, body and skin piercing services, and outdoor pools can lawfully reopen. People are still not permitted to meet with others in a private home or garden, except as part of a support bubble, and cannot visit someone else’s home or garden even if they live outside the affected areas. Shielding will also remain in place but will be relaxed to allowed people to meet outdoors in a group of six while maintaining social distancing, and for single-adult households to form support bubbles.
