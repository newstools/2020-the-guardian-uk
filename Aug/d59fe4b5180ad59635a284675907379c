Atlético Madrid women have suspended their training only 10 days before the Champions League is due to restart after five positive Covid-19 tests. A statement from the club confirmed that four players had tested positive for the virus on Tuesday after a first player was identified as having contracted the disease last Friday. Training has been suspended and players, coaching staff and assistants have been quarantined. In addition, the club has decided, as a preventive measure, to stop all activity at the Wanda Alcalá de Henares Sports Center, the training base for Atléti Femenino and Atléti’s youth teams, with the entire facility being disinfected. All five positive cases are asymptomatic with the players, who have not been named, isolated in their homes and in contact with the club’s medical staff. The players will undergo new tests in the coming days. Atléti are due to resume their Champions League campaign with a quarter-final against La Liga rivals Barcelona in Bilbao on 21 August. The UWCL is due to be played over nine days with the final scheduled to take place in San Sebastián on 30 August. Glasgow City face German champions Wolfsburg also on 21 August while Arsenal play Paris Saint-Germain and holders Lyon take on Bayern Munich the following evening.
