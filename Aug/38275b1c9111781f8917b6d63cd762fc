Protests have broken out in Belarus after Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, claimed he had won a landslide victory in an election marred by accusations of vote-rigging. In clashes that took place on Sunday, riot police used rubber bullets, flash grenades, teargas and a water cannon to quash protests.
