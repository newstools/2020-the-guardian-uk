The UK government has confirmed that France would be removed from the UK’s travel corridor safety list, following a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. The decision will mean holidaymakers arriving into the UK from France, after 0400 on Saturday morning, will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days or face a fine. The Netherlands, Malta, Monaco, British overseas territory the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the island of Aruba, a Dutch constituent country in the Caribbean, are also being removed from the safe list. We’d like to hear from UK holidaymakers who are changing plans because of the move. Are you trying to come back from France or any of the other countries early?
