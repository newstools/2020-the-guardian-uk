Alexis Sánchez has completed his free transfer from Manchester United to Internazionale on a contract to 30 June 2023. The Chile international has been on loan at Inter since August but United have been covering a significant portion of his £390,000-a-week wages. The Italian club are understood to have committed to matching that salary for the first season of their deal. The 31-year-old’s contract at Old Trafford had two years to run and United are saving about £40m in wages. They are also understood to have given Sánchez a pay-off. Sánchez’s exit helps to clear the way for the anticipated signing of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. The forward failed to live up to expectation at Old Trafford after joining from Arsenal in January 2018, with poor form and injuries meaning he leaves having scored five goals in 45 United appearances. “Everyone at Manchester United wishes Alexis Sánchez all the best in his future career,” the club said. Sánchez has played 30 times for Inter, scoring four goals, and came on in the 70th minute of Wednesday’s 2-0 Europa League win over Getafe in which Romelu Lukaku and Christian Eriksen scored. United and Inter will face one another in the final of the Europa League in Cologne if they progress. United face Copenhagen in the quarter-finals and Inter will play Bayer Leverkusen or Rangers, who complete their tie on Thursday with the German club 3-1 up.
