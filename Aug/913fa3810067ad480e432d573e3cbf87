Sir Gavin Lightman was encouraging, friendly and frank, and without any side. When I served the first six months of my pupillage at 13 Old Square, Lincoln’s Inn, he was one of the many talented and generous members of the chambers. In those days the barristers of Lincoln’s Inn usually wore bowler hats on their walk from chambers to the court on the Strand. I emulated my pupil master’s example, but not after Gavin said to me: “Winston, you and I are of this age and we need not wear bowler hats.”
