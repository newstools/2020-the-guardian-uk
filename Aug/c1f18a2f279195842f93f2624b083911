Hospitals in the Lebanese capital of Beirut are buckling under the weight of casualties following an explosion in the city on Tuesday which killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000. More than 100 people remain missing, and many are feared to have been trapped under the rubble. The blast, thought to have been caused by large stores of the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate, has caused massive devastation across the city.
