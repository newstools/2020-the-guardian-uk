Kyle Rittenhouse, who is suspected of involvement in fatally shooting two people and wounding another during the Kenosha, Wisconsin, protests Tuesday night, appears to have long been interested in law enforcement – and considered himself a militia member working to protect property, social media posts and reports indicate. Rittenhouse, 17, was arrested Wednesday and charged with first degree intentional homicide for his alleged role in the shootings. He is presently jailed in nearby Lake county, according to law enforcement documents. A Facebook account under Rittenhouse’s name, which can no longer be accessed, contained photos of him posing with an apparent assault-style rifle. Text surrounding the photo includes the pro-police phrase “blue lives matter”. Several other photos on this profile page feature that wording, as well as images showing local law enforcement agencies’ logos. In December 2018, Rittenhouse created a fundraiser for “Humanizing the Badge,” an organization “seeking to forge stronger relationships between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve”. The post indicates that Rittenhouse was seeking donations for his birthday. “Their mission means a lot to me, and I hope you’ll consider contributing as a way to celebrate with me,” the post read. A Facebook page belonging to a middle-aged woman identifies this same Rittenhouse as her son. On this page, this woman and a boy who appears to be Rittenhouse are posing in a photo together and he is wearing a law enforcement-style uniform. Several videos posted to TikTok also show a male who appears to be Rittenhouse firing guns. In a video posted to Twitter by a journalist for conservative media outlet the Daily Caller, a male who appears to be Rittenhouse stands with his gun, explaining why he is present at protests. “So people are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,” he explained, saying that part of his job was also to help injured people. “I’m running into harm’s way, that’s why I have my rifle,” he said, “to protect myself obviously”. “I also have my med kit,” he said, showing an orange bag to the camera. Attempts to reach Rittenhouse’s family were not immediately successful.
