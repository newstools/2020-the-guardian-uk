Topshop is accepting payment from shoppers and then not sending orders, not refunding returns, not responding to emails and not manning phone lines. It is continuing to take orders online but appears not to pass the items to the courier. Its score on Trustpilot is between one and two. My own order (about £100-worth of clothes) should have been collected for return on 26 June, but the courier did not turn up. It does not seem to have a customer service phone line. I have since sent several emails which have been ignored. There is no response via Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. An adviser at the Leeds store suggested asking the post office to print a label (the Topshop website won’t let me print one) or returning the items in-store. But reviews on Trustpilot indicate people are not receiving refunds for items they return by post.GM, Manchester There are numerous complaints on Trustpilot from people who have used the postal/courier return service and not received a refund, thereby ending up with no clothes and no refund. Readers have also complained about being unable to get through. You were also incorrectly charged £2.99 for delivery despite the order being worth about £97, which should have qualified for free delivery. We got in touch with Topshop which took steps to collect your parcel (via Hermes) and arrange a full refund. It has also apologised. To protect its employees, Topshop/Topman’s customer care phone lines have, indeed, been closed. Customers are directed to information and FAQs here, where they can also email if they require further assistance. We gather that customer service responses are back to normal levels, although that’s hardly good news for all those, like you, left in the lurch. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
