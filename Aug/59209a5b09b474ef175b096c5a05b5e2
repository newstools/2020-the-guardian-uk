This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from Rye Art Gallery Collection. The gallery holds a permanent collection of hundreds of works, mostly two dimensional, but including some three-dimensional pieces. The majority are of the early 20th century, including some by artists of national importance – Burra and Nash, who lived in Rye, also Grant, Bell, Hitchens, Gill, Piper, Sutherland, Cuming and others.
