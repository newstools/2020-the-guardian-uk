Romelu Lukaku scored and tormented the Bayer Leverkusen defence as he led Internazionale into the Europa League semi-finals with a 2-1 win on Monday. Nicolò Barella put Inter ahead after 15 minutes, driving the ball home after Lukaku’s shot was blocked, and six minutes later the Belgian got on the scoresheet when he displayed his strength by holding off defender Edmond Tapsoba before firing home. The Leverkusen winger Kai Havertz, reported to be a Chelsea transfer target, pulled a goal back but it was goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky who kept them in the game with a string of fine saves. After scoring what proved to be the winner, Lukaku could have had a second goal when Inter were awarded a penalty for handball, but that harsh decision against Leverkusen was overturned by VAR. Tapsoba struggled all night to contain the physicality of 27-year-old Lukaku, who set a record by scoring in nine straight Europa League games, and in the second half the centre-back resorted to hacking down the striker on a number of occasions. Seeking their first trophy since a 2011 Coppa Italia triumph, Inter sent on Alexis Sánchez in the second half and he had two excellent efforts blocked by last-ditch defending. Lukaku was again denied a penalty by VAR after an Inter player was discovered to have handled just before Christian Eriksen was bundled over in the box, and he fired a late shot wide under pressure from Tapsoba as Inter held on for victory. Lukaku showed plenty of humility after his dominant performance, saying: “To me, the man of the match is Barella. The way he plays football is simply incredible - maturity, quality. He is truly a great player.” The win sets up a semi-final against Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk or Basel of Switzerland, who meet on Tuesday
