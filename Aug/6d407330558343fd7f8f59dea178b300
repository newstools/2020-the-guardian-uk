FA Cup replays have been scrapped for the forthcoming season and prize money reduced to 2017-18 levels as a result of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. With a shortened season starting a month later than usual there is more pressure on an already compacted calendar, so the Football Association has taken the decision that all ties in the cup competition will be decided on the day. Participating clubs will also be financially affected. “In order to assist in easing pressure on the football schedule, there will be no replays for the 2020-21 season,” read an FA statement. “After two seasons of record levels of prize funds, the FA Cup prize fund has returned back in line with 2017-18 levels due to the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.” Significant changes have also been made by the Football League to the Carabao Cup, which will see the first four rounds compressed into consecutive weeks in September and the two-legged semi-finals abolished. The Premier League has confirmed the 2020-21 top-flight season will begin “on the weekend of Saturday 12 September”, ending on Sunday 23 May. Premier League and EFL fixtures for the new season will be released on 21 August.
