I’m writing to provide some consolation to Jeremy Whittle after reading his analysis (Ineos’s Tour de France team marks end of road for Britain’s cycling empire, 19 August). I have some good news – the picture isn’t so bad. If you want to see future British talent, just widen the lens. Take a look at the women’s world tour, where a number of rising cycling stars are forging paths on the international circuit. The leading team on the women’s world tour, Team Sunweb, boasts two under-23 riders, Anna Henderson and Pfeiffer Georgi, while Trek-Segafredo has recently snapped up 18-year-old Elynor Bäckstedt. It’s true that for much of Britain’s cycling fanbase, “it is only the Tour that really matters”. But media coverage (or lack thereof) plays a huge role in creating the stories of cycling success. I’m excited to see what the future has in store for the next generation of British talent. I’m sure fans would be excited by their stories too – we just need our mighty sports journalists to widen the lens and shine light on them more.
