More than 100 pilots at Jet2 are to lose their jobs after the airline rejected alternative proposals, according to the pilots union. In June, the British Airline Pilots’ Association union (Balpa) said the Leeds-based carrier had proposed cutting 102 pilot jobs after flights were grounded as a resut of the coronavirus pandemic. On Saturday, Balpa confirmed that Jet2 was pressing ahead with the cuts even though the union had put forward a range of alternative options. Several other airlines – including British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair – have announced job cuts after a collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. Balpa’s general-secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “This announcement is yet another which shows the desperate state of the British aviation sector. “Despite enormous efforts to work with Jet2 to find ways of saving these jobs, the airline is insisting on 102 redundancies. “This will be a particular kick in the teeth as many of those who may lose their jobs have recently joined the airline after having been dismissed from Thomas Cook, which went into administration last year.” Jet2.com said: “We are greatly distressed and deeply regret these redundancies that are entirely caused by the current situation.” Strutton called for support for the industry, which has also been affected by the implementation of quarantines on travellers from various holiday destinations. He said: “The government has a significant role to play in supporting the vital British aviation industry. Its quarantine changes keep throwing every restart plan into chaos. “If these quarantines are really needed, the government must stump up the support to help the airline industry, which is doing its best to get back on track but keeps being knocked back at every juncture.”
