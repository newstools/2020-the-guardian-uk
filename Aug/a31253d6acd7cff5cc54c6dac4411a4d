The Auschwitz museum has called a new trend, where users of video-sharing app TikTok role-play as Holocaust victims, “hurtful and offensive,” but added that it did not want to shame young people involved. The museum at the site of the former Nazi death camp was responding to the point of view videos. The short clips feature youths recounting how they died in the Holocaust, and sometimes show them sporting fake bruises, a striped inmate outfit or one of the armbands marked with the Star of David Jews were ordered to wear. The 'victims' trend on TikTok can be hurtful & offensive. Some videos are dangerously close or already beyond the border of trivialization of history.But we should discuss this not to shame & attack young people whose motivation seem very diverse. It's an educational challenge. pic.twitter.com/CB4Ve2uRUK “The ‘victims’ trend on TikTok can be hurtful & offensive. Some videos are dangerously close or already beyond the border of trivialization of history,” the Auschwitz Memorial said on Twitter. “Some were not created to commemorate anyone, but to become part of an online trend. This is very painful. “But we should discuss this, not to shame & attack young people whose motivation seem very diverse,” it added. The Holocaust site has become a symbol of the Nazi’s genocide of six million European Jews, with approximately one million people killed at the camp between 1940 and 1945 including more than 100,000 non-Jews, according to the museum.
