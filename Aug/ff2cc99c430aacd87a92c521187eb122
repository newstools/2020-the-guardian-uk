The Rolling Stones will open a flagship store in London’s Soho selling clothing and merchandise, including special glassware developed with Baccarat, engraved with the band’s tongue logo. RS No 9 Carnaby at 9 Carnaby Street will also feature raincoats and hats from the Swedish brand Stutterheim. It has been jointly curated by the Rolling Stones and the merchandising company Bravado, and the shop will showcase the band’s colours of red and black. The store will introduce Stones Red, an official colour from Pantone, which is established from the first use of the band’s famous logo, and a collection celebrating the official Pantone colour will also launch with the store. The glass floor will feature song lyrics, while the fitting rooms will be adorned with famous album artwork. The window features a soundwave installation taken from the opening to the 1966 hit track Paint It Black. The Rolling Stones said: “Soho has always encapsulated rock‘n’roll so Carnaby Street was the perfect spot for our own store. We are confident this exciting project that our friends at Bravado have created will be an unrivalled experience for everyone to come to London and enjoy.” The shop will open on 9 September.
