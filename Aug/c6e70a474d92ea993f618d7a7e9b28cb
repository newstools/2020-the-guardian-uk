The Dutch cyclist Fabio Jakobsen, who was put in a medically-induced coma after crashing at the finish line in the Tour of Poland’s first stage on Wednesday, is awake and in good condition, race organisers said on Friday. Jakobsen, who rides for the Belgian team Deceuninck-Quick Step, was trying to jostle for position with Dylan Groenewegen of Jumbo-Visma but the pair collided and Jakobsen crashed into the barriers, also injuring a race official. The 23-year-old was taken to hospital and underwent facial surgery. Groenewegen was disqualified from the race and Jakobsen was awarded the stage one win. “We have good news from the hospital in Sosnowiec! @FabioJakobsen is awake now from the coma. Condition is ‘good’,” the race organisers said on Twitter. The hospital added that Jakobsen will have to go through a long rehabilitation process but he is not showing any neurological symptoms. “The patient is conscious, follows orders, is disconnected from the ventilator, so he is breathing alone,” the hospital’s director told a news conference. “I think that if he survived such a fall, he will return to sport for sure.” We have good news from the hospital in Sosnowiec! @FabioJakobsen is awake now from the coma. Condition is "good". 👌#tdp20 @deceuninck_qst Cycling’s governing body, the UCI, issued a statement strongly condemning the “dangerous behaviour” of Groenewegen, accusing him of causing the crash. The rider apologised for his actions in a statement on Thursday. The race was meant to be held in July but was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was reduced to five stages from the original seven in order to leave room on the calendar for other rescheduled races.
