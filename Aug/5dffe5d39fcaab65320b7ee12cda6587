It’s never too late to brush up on your linguistic skills, n’est-ce pas? Certo. Language is fascinating, but our knowledge of it is beset by myths and fallacies. We’re here to clear some of those up – and allow you to impress your friends by whipping out facts about kennings, furry animals and proto-Indo-European (all will become clear). Enjoy! David Shariatmadari is the author of Don’t believe a word: from myths to misunderstandings – how language really works. We hope you enjoyed the quiz. Remember it is just for fun and there are no prizes. If you do think there is an egregious error that needs correcting, then you can email david.shariatmadari@theguardian.com
