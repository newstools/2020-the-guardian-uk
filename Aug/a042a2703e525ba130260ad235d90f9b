Southampton have announced an abrupt end to their sponsorship arrangement with LD Sports, suggesting that the Chinese brand is no longer an appropriate and viable partner. The club have struck a one-year deal at short notice with Sportsbet.io and the online gambling company will be their front-of-shirt sponsor for the 2020-21 season. It is hugely embarrassing for Southampton, less than three weeks before the start of the new campaign, and they have pledged to work with supporters who have bought LD Sports-sponsored shirts to provide a suitable solution. The club announced the deal with LD Sports in May of last year when they described it as a “new sports content, marketing and entertainment platform”, although little was known about the company. Southampton are owned by Gao Jisheng, a Chinese businessman, and the deal with LD Sports was said to have been struck by one of his China-based employees. Gao owns 80% of the club and he and his family had the option to purchase the remaining 20% this summer from Katharina Liebherr, the former majority shareholder. It is unclear whether Gao has done so. Southampton said in a statement: “Over the last week, we have endeavoured to secure confirmation that LD Sports are still an appropriate and viable partner for the club but have been left with no alternative other than to end the partnership today with immediate effect. “The club has also taken the difficult decision to temporarily halt all sales of home, away and third kits. Fans who have already purchased a 20-21 home, away or third shirt with LD Sports on the front are kindly asked for their patience and understanding at this time whilst the club resolves what is an extremely complex situation and sources a solution for updating their shirts.”
