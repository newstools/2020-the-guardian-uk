Nick Kyrgios has accused Novak Djokovic of lacking “leadership and humility” after Djokovic and fellow competitors tested positive for coronavirus earlier this summer. Kyrgios’ comments came after Djokovic, who is currently playing at the Cincinnati Open in New York, had been asked about the possibility of going through 2020 unbeaten after a 20-0 start to the year for the world No 1. In a post on his Twitter account, the 25-year-old Australian said: “Hell of a tennis player. May go unbeaten in 2020, can’t take that away from him. Unfortunately when he was supposed to show some leadership and humility he went missing. Majority would say he has taken an L regardless.” Djokovic, Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki all returned positive tests after taking part in the Adria Tour, a tournament organised by the 17-times grand slam winner in June. The opening leg of the event took place at the 33-year-old’s tennis complex in Belgrade and the second in Zadar in Croatia. Although the tournament did not breach any official protocols in Serbia or Croatia, Djokovic was heavily criticised after players hugged at the net, posed for photographs and attended joint press conferences. The reigning Wimbledon champion and his wife Jelena, who had also tested positive, returned negative results nine days later after self-isolating. Djokovic later apologised and insisted the event had been organised with the best of intentions. He somewhat went back on that stance last week, however, when he described the criticism around the Adria Tour as a “witch hunt”.
