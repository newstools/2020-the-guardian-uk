This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by Southampton City Art Gallery, which holds one of the finest collections of art in the south of England. Comprising more than 5,000 art works and spanning eight centuries, the collection is an outstanding educational resource that can trace the history of European art from the Renaissance to the present day; at its core are British 20th-century and contemporary art.
