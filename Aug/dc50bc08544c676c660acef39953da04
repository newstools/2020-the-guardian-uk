Arsenal have agreed a deal with Lille for Gabriel Magalhães worth around £22m but still face competition from Napoli to sign the Brazilian defender. The 22-year-old has been linked with several clubs in recent weeks, having initially look set to agree a move to Everton earlier in the year. But while Manchester United have also been credited with an interest, it is understood Arsenal’s offer of €24m has been accepted and Gabriel must now decide whether to move to the Emirates. The situation is complicated Napoli’s interest in the Brazil Under-20 international, who is seen as a direct replacement for Kalidou Koulibaly should the Senegal international leave. Koulibaly is available for around £75m, with Manchester City believed to be among the clubs who have expressed an interest in the 29-year-old. Gabriel played in 24 of Lille’s 28 matches in a curtailed 2019-20 Ligue 1 campaign and could follow Nicolas Pépé in moving to the Emirates. “He is one of the players that we allowed to exit the club this summer, he asked for it and wants to try something else,” said Lille president Gerard Lopez at the weekend. “We clearly told him what our expectations were, we spoke to a number of clubs, our expectations were met by a number of clubs and we have given him the time to decide.” Lille have already signed Gent’s Jonathan David as a replacement for Victor Osimhen, who moved to Napoli last month for an initial €60m.
