Harry Kane has been unable to join up with Tottenham for pre-season training as he is currently self-isolating following a holiday in the Bahamas. The England captain was in the Caribbean island nation when it was added to the UK’s quarantine list this month. He has been at home with his wife and two children while José Mourinho’s squad began their preparations for the new season. Kane has to stay at home for a fortnight from the day he returned but is expected to be back at the club’s training centre next week. The 27-year-old should have no problems with being ready for the club’s Premier League opener with Everton on the weekend of 12 September, or England’s Nations League games against Iceland and Denmark the previous week. The striker recently spent the best part of four months on an individual training plan as part of his rehabilitation from a hamstring injury he suffered in January. Other Spurs players are reporting back to training on a staggered basis after a quick turnaround from the end of the delayed 2019-20 season. The new signings Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Joe Hart were among the first to report, with the likes of Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Harry Winks and Ben Davies also back. Spurs will take on Ipswich at home in their first pre-season friendly this Saturday.
