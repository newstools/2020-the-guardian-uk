England Women will travel to play Germany in a friendly on 27 October, in their first match since it was announced Phil Neville will be stepping down as manager next year. The Lionesses will take on Germany in Wiesbaden, and Neville will gather his players for a training camp at St George’s Park from 15 to 21 September. The Netherlands head coach, Sarina Weigman, will take over from Neville as England manager in September 2021. “I know the players are so hungry to pull on an England shirt again and this is a good test to see where we are early in the new season against strong opposition,” Neville said. “Germany away is a tough challenge but we know what we are capable of producing. I’m sure the players are excited about testing themselves against one of the best teams in the world.” England have not played a game since March in their disappointing SheBelieves Cup campaign in the USA, where they beat Japan but lost against both the hosts and Spain. Germany travelled to Wembley last November for a friendly, winning 2-1 in front of a record 77,768 fans. Coronavirus restrictions mean the fixture at the Brita Arena will be played behind closed doors. In April, the Football Association confirmed Neville would leave his post in the summer of 2021 with a new manager to lead the team into the delayed European Championship in England in 2022. Wiegman was announced in August as Neville’s replacement, and is set to take charge after coaching the Dutch team at the Tokyo Olympics. “Next year is going to be a vital one for the players ahead of some major international tournaments in quick succession,” Neville said. “While you can never fully replicate the pressure of a major finals, I know my squad will take a lot from the experience. I am sure the fans will be relishing the chance to see us play again – even if unfortunately it has to be on television.”
