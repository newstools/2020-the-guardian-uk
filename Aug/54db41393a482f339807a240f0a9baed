We would like to hear from people about their experiences arriving at UK airports, ports and train stations from countries on the quarantine list, such as Croatia, France, Spain and Luxembourg. Were you required to fill out a test and trace form? Was your temperature taken? Were you given a QR code for scanning? Did anyone check your passport? Was there any information indicating you needed to isolate for 14 days? We are also interested in hearing from people who have been contacted to ensure they have been quarantining. You can get in touch by filling in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists will be in contact for publication before we publish, so please do leave contact details. If youâ€™re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
