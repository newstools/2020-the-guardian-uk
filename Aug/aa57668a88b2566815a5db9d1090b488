The aniseedy tones of tarragon work beautifully with gin, especially when balanced by the sharpness of lemon in this refreshing, post-work tipple. The syrup makes enough for six serves, but it’s really not worth making in any smaller quantity: keep any you don’t use in a jar in the fridge. Serves 1 For the tarragon syrup½ bunch tarragon50g white sugar50ml waterJuice of ½ lemon For the drink (per serve)1 tbsp tarragon syrup50ml lemon juice50ml gin125ml sparkling water, or tonic, if you prefer Start with the syrup. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and have ready a small ice bath. Blanch the tarragon in the boiling water for four or five seconds, then plunge it straight into the ice bath. In a second pan, dissolve the sugar in 50ml water at a steady simmer, leave to cool, then add the drained tarragon and lemon juice, and blend. To make the drink, put the syrup, lemon juice and gin in a shaker, add a good handful of ice and shake hard. Fill a highball glass with ice, strain in the contents of the shaker and top with sparkling water. • Alex Hely-Hutchinson, Stoney Street by 26 Grains, London SE1
