These are difficult times for optimists but a low-profile race at Leopardstown on Thursday lifted the spirits of pinsticking punters, as well as those of most bookmakers, by providing a winner at the record-breaking odds of 300-1. He Knows No Fear was the horse in question and his name could surely be applied to any bettor taking a chance on him, as the colt had achieved next to nothing in his only previous race, barely beating the ambulance to the finishing line. He is trained by Luke Comer, for whom racing is very much a sideline compared to the property developing business that made him wealthy. “We haven’t time, really, to concentrate on it,” Comer’s brother, Brian, said once and perhaps that explains why Comer-trained horses have become a byword for hopelessness; this was their first winner on the Flat for nine years. With that in mind, the many punters who made Agitare the hot favourite on Thursday must have been counting their money when their handsome chestnut went clear in the straight, with only a horse in the Comer colours to beat. Alas for them, He Knows No Fear produced a relentless surge up the middle of the track to poke his nose in front with inches to spare.Incredibly, the bookmaker Paddy Power said almost 100 of its customers had backed the winner, albeit to small stakes, which is perhaps an indication that the spirit of optimism dies very hard indeed. “These punting heroes have either been struck by divine inspiration or are extremely shrewd form judges,” said a spokesman, a note of bitterness perhaps detectable behind the sarcasm.Ladbrokes Coral reported 63 winning bets taken through their websites, the biggest stake being £2.50 each-way. But a single punter in their Main Street, Dublin branch had been braver, they said, staking €100 each-way for a payout of €36,000.Comer’s assistant, Jim Gorman, revealed that staff at the yard had thought enough of He Knows No Fear to have a few quid on when he made his thoroughly disappointing racecourse debut. Perhaps some of them had enough insight to go in again but, if so, Gorman omitted to mention it. 300-1!He Knows No Fear, the biggest-priced winner in British and Irish racing history.

The previous record in Ireland was 200-1, set by another jumper, Killahara Castle, three years ago.Comer’s yard was last in the headlines in 2017, when he was repeatedly fined by the Irish authorities for failing to comply with regulations on how his stable should be run. Among other infractions, he was found to have provided inadequate supervision for his horses and to have refused officials access to his training premises.

Comer, who did not respond to requests for comment, is presumably a lot happier about the racing side of his business now.
