Jack Charlton made more than 25 documentary films with me, about everything from salmon fishing and the Duke of Buccleuch (affectionately referred to as “his dukiness” by Jack) to his national service in the cavalry and the delights of Blackpool. He was always helpful, friendly, considerate and a good listener. He was also very funny. Jack always referred to me as “one” because he said I “sounded a bit POSH”. One will miss him very much.
