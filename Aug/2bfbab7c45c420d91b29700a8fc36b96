This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, these come from the De Morgan Collection. Featuring Pre-Raphaelite-style paintings by Evelyn De Morgan and ceramics by her husband William, this unique collection preserves the artistic legacy of a radical Victorian couple. They believed art could create a better, more beautiful world. Evelyn’s sister founded the collection, exhibited today in museums and galleries across the UK. You can see art from the De Morgan Collection on Art UK here. Find out more on the collection’s website here.
