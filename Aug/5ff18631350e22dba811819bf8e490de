Robin van Persie says he has joined Feyenoord’s staff to help their forwards with their finishing - although he is not sure what his exact title is - and to see whether coaching is something he might like to pursue. The former Manchester United and Arsenal striker finished his started and finished his career with Feyenoord, eventually retiring from playing in 2019, which this being his first coaching role. “It is not an official function,” Van Persie said. “That’s why I find it difficult to give it a name. For example, I don’t see myself as a striker coach. I think it’s a win-win situation: I’m going to find out here if I like this and I help the staff a bit.” Coach Dick Advocaat is trying to persuade the 37-year-old to join his staff on a more permanent basis. The pair previously worked together at Turkish club Fenerbahçe. “I was supposed to join last season, but that didn’t happen. Dick called me and asked if I wanted to come. And you can’t say no to Dick.” Van Persie, who won 102 caps for the Netherlands, has mainly worked as a pundit since retirement, appearing on BT Sport in the UK. ”Over the past year I have only done things that I enjoy,* said Van Persie. “I worked as an analyst in England, I travelled a lot with my family. Now I’m going to see if this is also something I enjoy”
