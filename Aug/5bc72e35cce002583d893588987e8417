Manchester United are hopeful of signing Donny van de Beek from Ajax as the race for the Netherlands midfielder nears completion. Van de Beek has attracted interest from several of Europe’s leading clubs having excelled for the Dutch side over the past three seasons, with Real Madrid and Barcelona among those to have been linked with the 23-year-old in recent months. But it is understood that United are in touch with his agents and believe they have a good chance of concluding a deal with Ajax given their strong links to the Eredivisie champions thanks to former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who is Ajax’s chief executive. Real are also believed to still be interested in signing a player who has scored 41 goals in 175 appearances for Ajax’s first team having joined the club as an 11-year-old. Barcelona have denied they are preparing an offer, with Tottenham also having previously tracked Van de Beek. “There are indeed developments that keep him out of the selection,” admitted Ajax manager Erik ten Hag on Saturday. “We will see what happens. We’ll make an announcement as soon as there’s some clarity.” He added: “The fact that Donny did not play does indicate a direction.The request not to let him play did not come specifically from one side. We do that together. Agreements have been made about a possible transfer, and if that possibility arises, you must also cooperate.” The signing of Van de Beek would be a potential coup for United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who wants to strengthen his midfield options ahead of the new season. Talks over the potential signing of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund have yet to be resolved, while United are also in the market for a new centre back.
