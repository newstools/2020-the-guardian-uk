There’s one word in the first song that proves why Manic Street Preachers remain such an important band. Their frontman, James Dean Bradfield, that pocket pugilist with a valley chorister’s voice, has made an album-length tribute to Víctor Jara, the Chilean musician and activist murdered by Pinochet’s mob. Yet it’s the word “cofiwch” that leads me to learn about the deliberate drowning of one of our last Welsh-speaking villages in 1965. The lyrics are adapted from Welsh playwright Patrick Jones’s poems about Jara, and Bradfield assembles them to tell us about music, and how musicians such as Jara can tell stories that keep the past and the dead alive to walk with the living. While doing the same himself. A neat trick. This is the Manics’ greatest strength: their passion for history and learning, and an undimmed desire to share it. Jones’s words are punchy and direct – nothing like his brother Nicky Wire’s cut-up punk philosophies, but still as stirring – and Bradfield supplies his usual tender bombast. Some of it could be sketches for a musical, and there’s real intelligence and verve to the electronic, acoustic and orchestral arrangements, with surprising yet successful touches of prog and psychedelia.
