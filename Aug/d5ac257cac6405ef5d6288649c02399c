Arsenal’s overhaul of their scouting network has continued, with several more high-profile recruitment personnel being told they will be made redundant. The club announced plans for 55 job losses on Wednesday, with the scouting department heavily hit. Francis Cagigao, the head of recruitment, was the highest-profile name to be released, and Pete Clark and Brian McDermott were also told their services were no longer required. Now the club have informed Ty Gooden, who covers France and Belgium, that he will not be retained and further changes are being made across their international operation. Leonardo Scirpoli, who has overseen their scouting in Germany since last summer, will also lose his job and similar news has befallen their scout in Scotland, Alex Stafford, and the Spain scout, Julio de Marco. The club’s Italian operation has also been cut. While some internally feel the overhaul has been long-planned, it has caused surprise within Arsenal and at several other leading European clubs. There is no indication yet as to how Arsenal intend to restructure the scouting operation after losing this top-level talent. Cagigao made his name with the discoveries of Cesc Fàbregas and Héctor Bellerín, among others, and has not been short of admirers elsewhere throughout his 24 years serving the club. Some observers of Arsenal’s recruitment methods are concerned they are moving towards an agent-led approach. Kia Joorabchian has been involved in several of their recent deals and another of his clients, Willian, is closing in on a free-transfer move from Chelsea.
