In the five years or so since his emergence, Los Angeles-based artist Duckwrth, AKA Jared Lee, has established himself as one to watch.His work spans a range of disciplines, creating visuals and prose alongside his music. Even his songs delve into an array of genres that perhaps best place him alongside the smooth sounds of fellow singer-rappers Goldlink, Aminé or Anderson .Paak – but he also has JPEGMAFIA-style visceral, caustic tracks in his back catalogue. The former sound is closer to where he picks up on this, his highly anticipated debut studio album. SuperGood is a record rooted in the west coast. It sounds like summer nights driving with the wind in your face: luxe synths, funky licks of guitar and breezy basslines. The loungey, glowing pop is comforting to sink into – the glimmering Super Bounce, featuring Earthgang, is a standout, while Duckwrth has said that the uplifting closing track, Find a Way, is a reminder that we’re not alone in these overwhelming times. Though there are enough intricacies to keep you interested – ornate percussion, switches in pace and vocal delivery – largely this is a warm and easy listen.
