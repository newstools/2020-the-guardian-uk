The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) The Blob (1958) Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) 3 Women (1977) The Killing (1956) Ten Seconds to Hell (1959) It’s All True (1941, the “natives rowing to sea” segment) The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) Hour of the Wolf (1968) Desperate Living (1977) Repulsion (1965) The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick (1972) Fat City (1972) The Lady of the Camellias (1981) You Can’t Cheat an Honest Man (1939) The Gospel According to St Matthew (1964) Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983, the George Miller segment) Los Olvidados (1950) Sherlock Jr (1924) Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone, 1961) The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street (The Twilight Zone, 1960) The Zanti Misfits (The Outer Limits, 1963) 20/20 (Way Out, 1961) Why now? I have no answer except to add The Devils (1971) and To Live and Die in LA (1985) and Fort Apache (1948) and Seven Beauties (1975) and Triumph of the Will (1935) to add a little colour to this basically black-and-white list. Most were seen by a much younger me as a bit dark, but these are dark times. Still, the light becomes more evident in the darkness, as white seems more white next to black, although there are still infinite shades of grey.
