A man has died after reports of a disturbance and rocks being thrown in the grounds of a castle in Kent, police have said. Kent police said officers were called to the grounds of Lullingstone Castle in Eynsford at 5.21pm on Thursday. The force added: “It was reported that rocks were being thrown. “A man later died at the scene and officers from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate are investigating.” Other news reports said the man was aged in his 70s. Lullingstone Castle was built in 1497 and is a tourist attraction in the area, featuring a 15-acre lake and several gardens containing international plants. The estate, near the Brands Hatch racing circuit, has been owned by members of the same family since the 15th century. It is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
