Away from the hospital wards and empty streets, this pandemic has changed our day-to-day lives and how we relate to one another in ways we could never have anticipated. We are launching a new podcast, All By Ourselves, to tell these stories. We want to document how our changing world is affecting our personal lives: our homes, our relationships and our inner selves. In each episode of All By Ourselves we will hear from people from across the world about their lives. We don’t have a theme. We want to be led by you and listen in on a new way of life. If you have a story you want to share – big or small, funny or tragic, weird or wonderful – we want to hear from you. You can get in touch by filling in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists may be in contact, so please do leave contact details.
