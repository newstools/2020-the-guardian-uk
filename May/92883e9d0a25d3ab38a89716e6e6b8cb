This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Dorich House Museum at Kingston University, located on the edge of Richmond Park in southwest London – it is the former studio home of the sculptor Dora Gordine and her husband Richard Hare. The accredited museum holds the world’s largest collection of Gordine’s work and an important collection of Russian art and artefacts, acquired by Hare and Gordine during their marriage. You can see art from Dorich House Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the Dorich House Museum website here.
