Ole Gunnar Solskjær has said playing Premier League games behind closed doors will be a challenge but believes Manchester United’s recent experience of doing so will help his players. United’s last match before football was suspended was the 5-0 win at Lask Linz in the last-16 of the Europa League, which was staged with no fans present at the Linzer Stadion. “It’s going to be difficult but we played Lask just before lockdown and played fantastically well,” Solskjær told manutd.com. “That must play [positively] in the boys’ heads. We’re capable of playing without an atmosphere. You’ve got to create it yourself as well, within the team. “I was impressed with that game – how focused we were. The gaffer [Sir Alex Ferguson, former United manager] always used to say: ‘Concentrate, play with determination.’ Everyone plays with concentration but that was focus. I hope we don’t get used to it – football is to be played in front of fans with passion and excitement. “We’ve been watching what’s been happening in Germany. For us to follow their template, it’s important they can show everyone the way. It’s been great watching some live football, not just the old classics. We’ve been spending hours analysing our own games.” With nine Premier League games left United are fifth, three points behind Chelsea in fourth.
