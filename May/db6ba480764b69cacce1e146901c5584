This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Pier Arts Centre, Orkney. The centre, in Stromness, is home to a fine-art collection donated by the author, peace activist and philanthropist Margaret Gardiner (1904–2005). The collection of over 200 works includes works by major 20th-century artists Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, contemporary artists including Sean Scully and Eva Rothschild, and Orcadian artists Sylvia Wishart and Stanley Cursiter.
