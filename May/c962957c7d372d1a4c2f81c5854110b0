This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Its collection includes art from the Renaissance to artists emerging on the global scene today. The art gallery opened its doors in 1905 but the museum was founded in 1823. As well as art, the collection boasts archaeology, applied art, biology, Eastern art, Egyptology, geology, social, industrial and maritime history and world cultures.
