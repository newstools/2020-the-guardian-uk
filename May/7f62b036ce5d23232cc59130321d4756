I start each morning with two tasks: one, log an update into the Covid-19 app; two, make myself “available” for volunteering on the GoodSam app. I’ve now clocked just short of 500 hours of availability (Letters, 5 May) and not had a single task allocated, though I have received a free parking disc for use in the slots that the council have already made free in the local town I’m not allowed to visit. I assumed the lack of tasks was due to my rural location, but your correspondent hailed from London, so that can’t be it. Has anyone told those who need the service how to contact it?Dr Neil DenbyDenby Dale, West Yorkshire • Like Gloria Raven’s husband, I too have clocked up over 100 hours as an NHS volunteer and have yet to be called. In my case, as I’m over 70, I assume they think I ticked the wrong box.John HuntleyDidsbury, Manchester • While doing a clearout at the weekend, I came across a G2 fashion article from April 2014. At the end it said: “The look in 2020? High heels, cocktail dresses and mini bags. Just you wait and see.” We may have to wait a while for that.

As I understand it, there may well be two cases.James LeeAbergele, Conwy
