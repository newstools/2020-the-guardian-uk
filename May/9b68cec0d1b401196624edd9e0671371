For us it was the welcoming (toothless) smiles and rustic food at a remote taverna in the Cretan hills – our faith in a single hand-painted sign rewarded after what felt like hours of driving, car-sick youngster in the back. It’s easy with today’s technology to plan holidays to the last detail – even menu choices and coffee stops – but still the most memorable moments are the unplanned ones. This week we’d like to hear about the chance meetings and lucky finds that made your trip. Use the form below to tell us about the random place or person you still talk about long after that holiday – keeping your tip to about 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 19 May at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are very welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
