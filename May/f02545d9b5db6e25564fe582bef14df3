Promotion to the Premier League should be scrapped if Championship clubs fail to complete their season, according to the Norwich sporting director, Stuart Webber. Webber says bottom-placed Norwich will not accept a scenario in which they finish the campaign and are relegated, only to be replaced by a club whose season has been curtailed. Leeds and West Brom are in the Championship’s automatic promotion slots. “What we could not accept is a situation where we play all our games and get relegated but the Championship can’t play and they automatically promote some teams who haven’t finished the season,” Webber told the Sky Sports Football Show. “For anyone who has got promoted from the Championship, it is a 46- or 49-game slog … It needs to be settled on the pitch – both coming up and going down.” The English Football League is holding a board meeting on Wednesday and discussions among clubs will continue this week. Those in League One in League Two are resigned to their season not being completed. The EFL remains determined to finish the Championship provided it is safe to do so but some second-tier clubs have reservations. The league’s preferred contingency for the Championship if the season cannot be completed would be to promote Leeds and West Brom and to play the play-offs as per current positions.
