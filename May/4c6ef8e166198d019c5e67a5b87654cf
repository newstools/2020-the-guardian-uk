My spice rack holds an eclectic host of jars and containers, all jammed with berries, seeds and barks from around the world. It has pride of place in my kitchen: a pinch of this or that, ground down with my pestle and mortar, adds flavour, aroma and even a bit of glamour to everyday ingredients. It seems nothing short of magic. Now I must make use of all this time at home and label them all properly! These exceedingly good, coriander-laced carrots make a feast of a light lunch, or you can toss them with some warm dressed grains for a more substantial meal. Prep 15 minCook 40 minServes 4 800g carrots, peeled and cut into 3-4cm diagonal pieces4 garlic cloves, unpeeled2 tbsp coriander seeds, gently crushed3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilSalt and black pepper300g Greek yoghurt45g tahiniJuice of ½ lemon2 tsp honey2 handfuls mint leaves50g skin-on almonds Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the carrot pieces and garlic cloves in a bowl, add the coriander seeds and two tablespoons of olive oil, then season generously. Toss well with your hands to coat the carrots, and spread out on a roasting tray lined with baking paper. Roast for 25-35 minutes, until the carrots are tender and the edges are crisp. While the carrots are in the oven, whisk the yoghurt, tahini, lemon juice and honey. Season to taste, then put to one side. Put the almonds on a tray and toast in the oven for the final 10 minutes of the carrots’ cooking time. Remove the almonds from the oven and chop. Spoon the tahini yoghurt on to plates and top with the warm carrots. Rip over the mint leaves, scatter with the almonds and serve. The tahini yoghurt is great as a dressing for Mediterranean dishes such as moussaka or a slow-cooked, spiced lamb. It’s also delicious with a warm polenta or lemon cake.
