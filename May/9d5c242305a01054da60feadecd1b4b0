Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. The past few weeks have made me really grateful for postal workers, refuse collectors and a neighbour who helps people on my street. I’d like to thank them – but how? And should I ask other neighbours to contribute? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
