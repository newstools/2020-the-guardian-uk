Gregory Tyree Boyce, an actor in the film Twilight, and his girlfriend Natalie Adenike Adepoju were found dead last week in Las Vegas, authorities said on Tuesday. Clark county coroner John Fudenberg said foul play was not suspected in the 13 May deaths of Boyce, 30, and Adepoju, 27. Boyce appeared as Tyler Crowley in the 2008 film starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. His mother, Lisa Wayne, said in a Facebook post on Sunday she had planned to meet Boyce on Tuesday to talk about a chicken wing business they wanted to open. She referred also to Boyce’s 10-year-old daughter. Adepoju had a four-year-old son. The coroner said their causes and manners of death would not be known until medical examiners receive toxicology test results in several weeks’ time. The bodies were found after police were summoned to a report of a dead body in a residential complex several miles east of the Las Vegas Strip, police said. Las Vegas police officer Larry Hadfield, a department spokesman, said the deaths were not considered to be the result of a criminal act.
