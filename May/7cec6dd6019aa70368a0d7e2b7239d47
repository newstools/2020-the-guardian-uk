Regarding Adrian Chiles’ desire to continue his visits to “somewhere random” (What will I do when travel restrictions lift? Complete my odyssey to all 270 London tube stations, 6 May), can I recommend he takes on my completed challenge of walks from “end of the line” stations. There are 29, and I have devised 5 mile-plus circular walks from each. I can particularly recommend the walk from Heathrow Terminal 5, which has many surprising highlights, including the largest timber-framed building in England – the early 15th-century, Grade 1-listed Harmondsworth Great Barn.Andrew PowellLondon • Adrian Chiles’ intention might be unnecessary, but it is worthwhile. A colleague and I spent the best part of a year visiting every station, photographing their multifarious heritage features.Jonathan ClarkeLondon • In March, we were woken by the first K3 bus of the day. In April, it was birdsong. In May, it’s the crunch of gravel and the potato starch bag of the Guardian at the door. We’ve now moved to the back room.Tim HarrisonSurbiton, London • Samuel Gibbs’ list of running essentials (Running in lockdown: what gear do I need to start?, 9 May) misses the one thing essential for over half the population – a well-fitting bra. Much more necessary than a GPS watch. Perhaps he could give recommendations next week.Jill WestermanSheffield • I don’t wish to squash Prof Symonds’ optimism that insect numbers may be rising (Letters, 8 May), but is it possible that there is a correlation between the decrease in traffic and the increase in insects on his windscreen, ie fewer cars, therefore more insects per car?Dr Anne UnseldBeckenham, London
