Tomie dePaola was ahead of his time in terms of environmental awareness and gender roles. One of the loveliest picture books that I read to my now 40-something children was his Michael Bird-Boy (1975), whose understanding of the role of bees and flowers in the process transformed the practices of Boss Lady, who ran the environmentally unfriendly honey factory. I still have a copy, and the drawings and words are glorious.
