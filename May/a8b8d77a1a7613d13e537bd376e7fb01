Hertha Berlin celebrated their second successive win since the resumption of the Bundesliga after a dominant second-half performance gave them a 4-0 home derby victory over neighbours Union Berlin. Hertha brushed aside their city rivals thanks to four second-half goals, with Vedad Ibisevic’s 51st-minute header followed within seconds when Ibisevic turned provider for Dodi Lukebakio. The same source teed up Matheus Cunha for a low drive nine minutes later to make it three, before the former Manchester City and Celtic defender Dedryck Boyata headed in Marvin Plattenhardt’s corner 13 minutes from time. Union had won the reverse fixture in November 1-0 thanks to a late penalty but they failed to register a shot on target this time. Hertha’s players celebrated victory in front of the stadium’s east stand, where normally their most fervent supporters would be. “We know what the game means for our fans.” Ibisevic said. “This time we produced a really good performance.” Bullet header 💥Brilliant build-up, brilliant finish, Hertha Berlin take the lead in the derby! pic.twitter.com/KmWYNRep0L Victory for the home side followed up last Saturday’s 3-0 win at Hoffenheim when the league restarted after two months of inactivity due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Played behind closed doors, the result lifted Hertha one place up to 10th on 34 points from 27 games while promoted Union stayed 12th on 30 points.
