This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from moer than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Norfolk Museums Service, which consists of 10 museums across the beautiful county of Norfolk. Sites in Norwich include Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery, along with medieval merchants’ houses at Strangers’ Hall and the Museum of Norwich. Maritime collections abound at Great Yarmouth, Cromer and Kings Lynn. Discover rural history at Gressenhall and local treasures at the Ancient House at Thetford.
