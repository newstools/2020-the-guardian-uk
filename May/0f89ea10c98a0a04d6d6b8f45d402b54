Couples separated by France’s strict coronavirus rules will remain lovelorn after ministers ruled out a proposed change to the law extending the country’s state of health emergency. The “lovers’ amendment”, as it was called, was proposed by an MP during a debate on the legislation in the lower house the national assembly. Mireille Clapot, a member of Emmanuel Macron’s ruling centrist LREM party, suggested that “love” should be added to the list of “compelling reasons” people could use to justify travelling more than 100km (60 miles) from home, even after the strict lockdown ends on Monday. Tugging at the heartstrings of colleagues, Clapot made reference to the fact that many couples had been separated since midday on 17 March when the national order to stay at home came into effect. “The law has put so many restraints on public freedoms that it has more or less banned love,” Clapot told the house. She said the regulations, which require anyone leaving their home département and travelling more than 100km to prove that they have “compelling professional or family reasons”, were keeping couples apart. However, the health minister, Olivier Véran, was unmoved by the appeal. He said the government did not want to increase the number of exceptions to the rules and could not accept the amendment, but he thanked Clapot for “this tender moment” in the house. The proposed legislation will extend the state of emergency until 23 July. France will end its lockdown on Monday but parts of the country deemed “red” – where the virus is still circulating and there is pressure on hospital intensive care units – will retain some restrictions. These will be reviewed again in three weeks if there is no widespread increase in coronavirus cases.
