Espanyol and Leganés season-ticket holders will be handed free passes for the 2020-2021 campaign to compensate for missing matches owing to the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. La Liga is set to resume in June after being suspended in March with 11 rounds of matches remaining but, as in Germany, fans cannot attend games. It is unclear when spectators will be able to return to stadiums, with medical experts saying mass gatherings should be avoided until there is a vaccine. With the two clubs struggling at the bottom it is possible one or both could be playing in the second division next season. “Leganés will automatically renew all its season-ticket holders for the next season,” the club said. “Taking into account the implications that Covid-19 has brought to the country and specially the city of Leganés, the club wants to compensate its fans and season-ticket holders.” Espanyol said that in addition to offering its 27,833 season-ticket holders free 2020-2021 passes, they would also reimburse 20% of the value of their current season ticket. Getafe were the first La Liga club to offer season-ticket holders free passes for next season.
