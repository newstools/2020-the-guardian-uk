Chris Froome said the Tour de France can work without spectators but questioned how organisers can prevent crowds converging along the course. Initially due to start on 27 June, the pandemic has pushed the Tour back until 29 August and doubts remain given the differing Covid-19 situations across the world. The French government has said no mass gatherings can take place before September but the Tour will be allowed to go ahead on its new date if the opening stages are managed correctly. That is one of the main things Froome believes will be hard to manage as he continues to prepare for a tilt at another victory to add to the four he already has. “We can put the race on without people standing on the roads,” the Team Ineos rider said, “and it can be broadcast on television. You’re not going to get the same scenes as you would get going through tunnels of just people everywhere and all the rest of it. Maybe that’s the version of race we need to see this year. I don’t know. “In theory, we can put the race on but I think the bigger question is would the organisers be able to keep people from coming out and gathering in large crowds?” The 34-year-old, who missed last year’s race after sustaining career-threatening injuries in a crash, has been hitting the gym first thing every day to try to replicate what he would be doing in preparation for the Tour. “Some days I’m even doing up to six hours sitting on the stationary trainer – big days,” he told Kevin Pietersen on an Instagram Live. “It gets pretty boring at times. I’ve been through every playlist I own about 10 times each. But, yeah, just getting through it and doing the best I can. “I’m coming off the back of a big injury as well. A lot of the training I’ve been doing up until this point has been indoors, so it’s almost prepared me for this whole lockdown period. I think mentally I’m able to get through it a bit easier.”
