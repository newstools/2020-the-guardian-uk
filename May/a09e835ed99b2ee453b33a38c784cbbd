Perfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall? A pisco sour in Peru or a perky vinho verde in Portugal …? Whether we’re anticipating it, enjoying it or talking about it afterwards, eating and drinking are, for many, what travel is all about. This week we’d like to hear about your most memorable holiday food or drink experience, at home or abroad.

We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip.
