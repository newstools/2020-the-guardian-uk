Everton have agreed a three-year kit deal with the Danish sportswear company Hummel worth in the region of £9m per season. The club have been supplied by Umbro since 2014 but exercised an option to change manufacturers after one year of their latest agreement. The Umbro deal had been worth £4m-£5m per year. In February Everton announced they would end their sponsorship agreement with the Kenyan betting firm SportPesa two years early. Carlo Ancelotti’s players will continue to wear SportPesa-sponsored Umbro kits for the duration of the 2019-20 campaign and change to Hummel, and a new sponsor, at the start of next season. Hummel will kit out the men’s, women’s and academy squads as well as Everton in the Community staff. “It is really important that we drive maximum value from our commercial deals and this is a club record deal for a technical partnership for Everton,” said the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale. “We have all been impressed with Hummel’s originality, commitment to quality and vision to challenge expectations.” Allan Vad Nielsen, Hummel’s CEO, said: “Entry into the Premier League is integral to our ambitious growth plans, international expansion and focus on sport. Timing is also perfect as it is the 50th anniversary of club legend Alan Ball introducing Hummel to the UK market with his legendary white boots.” Despite securing a club-record kit deal, Everton’s income from Hummel is dwarfed by the Premier League’s biggest names. Manchester United, for example, earn £75m a year from their kit deal with Adidas and Liverpool’s new deal with Nike is estimated to be worth around £80m a year.
