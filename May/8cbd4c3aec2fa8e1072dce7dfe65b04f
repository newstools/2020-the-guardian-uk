West End theatres will remain closed until at least 28 June, the Society of London Theatres (Solt) announced on Tuesday. The organisation has been cancelling performances across the West End on a rolling basis, in line with the latest advice from the government during the Covid-19 lockdown. Those cancellations have now been extended from 31 May to 28 June. “This does not mean theatres will reopen on 29 June,” Solt stressed in its statement. “If further cancellations are necessary they will continue to be announced on a rolling basis.” The postponement of Sunday in the Park With George, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford, was also announced on Tuesday. The revival of the musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine was due to begin a 12-week run on 11 June. It is now slated to run at the Savoy theatre next year, with details to be confirmed. Gyllenhaal said: “We are, of course, disappointed to postpone our upcoming season, but know that safety is a top priority and science must lead the way. London’s West End is incredibly special to me, and it will be an absolute honour to return to the stage so we can eventually share Sunday in the Park With George with audiences in 2021.” Usually in a regular week, about 300,000 people visit West End theatres. Solt said it was a major undertaking to process refunds, exchanges and credit notes, particularly when many staff are working remotely, adding: “Please rest assured that we are all working as quickly as we can and we appreciate the ongoing support of our audiences.” Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said West End theatres are unlikely to be able to reopen until next year. “For major producers [on] both sides of the Atlantic, the truth is until social distancing doesn’t exist any more, we can’t even plan to reopen,” he said. “If we don’t hear [about lockdowns lifting] in a few weeks, we won’t be able to come back until early next year. I think that’s quite clear.”
