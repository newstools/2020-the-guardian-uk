The originator of the weekly “clap for carers” has said next Thursday’s show of support should be the last, amid concerns the event has become politicised. Annemarie Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she was “overwhelmed” by the support for the ritual, but it was better to stop while it was at its peak. She said: “I think it’s good to have the last of the series next Thursday, because to have the most impact I think it is good to stop it at its peak. “Without getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised. I think the narrative is starting to change and I don’t want the clap to be negative.” Millions of people across the UK have regularly paused to applaud frontline NHS staff, carers and health workers since the coronavirus outbreak. People have gathered in their gardens, balconies and on street corners, sometimes playing instruments or bashing pots and pans, to create a visual and audible show of support. Next Thursday will be the 10th weekly event, which was started as the UK went into lockdown in March and has been joined by members of the royal family, the prime minister and celebrities. But it has divided opinion: while some feel empowered and encouraged by the gesture, others think it is patronising, particularly in light of the government’s decision, later reversed, to continue charging overseas health and care staff for using the NHS. Plas said: “A clap is something normal people can do, showing our appreciation. But the power is not with us. We can give them respect but we are not signing the cheque – that falls on another desk.” She suggested resurrecting the ritual in 2021 to mark a year since the coronavirus outbreak and said: “Stopping clapping doesn’t mean we are not still appreciating them. Some people will still want to carry on, so they should. But we will show our support in other ways – there are other initiatives we can support.”
