The FA Cup final will be held on 1 August with the quarter-finals given provisional restart dates of 27 and 28 June. The resumption is 10 days after the Premier League is set to kick off again. The competition had reached the quarter-final stage when football in England was suspended on 13 March. No decision has been reached on whether the cup ties will be played at neutral venues. The semi-finals will take place over the weekend of 18 and 19 July, with the intention being for those matches and the final to be played at Wembley as usual. All the ties will be behind closed doors.

Its chief executive, Mark Bullingham, warned in April of the governing body facing losses of up to £150m as a result of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. He said on Friday: “We are pleased to agree the provisional restart date for the FA Cup. The competition has been an integral part of the English football calendar for nearly 150 years and we’d like to thank the Premier League executive and clubs for their support in scheduling the remaining matches during this unprecedented time. “This has been a difficult period for many people and while this is a positive step the restart date is dependent on all safety measures being met. The health and well-being of players, staff and supporters remains our priority.” The arrangements for broadcasting the matches are yet to be confirmed, with BT Sport and the BBC holding the UK rights. The split for the quarter-finals had been announced in March prior to the competition being suspended but it remains to be seen whether the same split will still apply.
