This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, they are set by the Wallace Collection, an internationally outstanding collection containing masterpieces of painting, sculpture, furniture, arms and armour and porcelain. Built during the 18th and 19th centuries by successive marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard Wallace, the collection was given to the British nation in 1897, so that it could be kept together and enjoyed. It was an astonishing bequest and one of the greatest gifts of art works ever transferred into public ownership. You can see art from the Wallace Collection on Art UK here.
