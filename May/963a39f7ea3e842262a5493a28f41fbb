New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was broadcast reacting live on television during a 5.8-magnitude earthquake in Wellington on Monday morning. The strong earthquake was centred 30km north west of Levin, a town around an hour’s drive north of the country’s capital, on the North Island. It was felt most sharply around the South Taranaki Bight, and the closest major town, Wellington, some 100km south. Tens of thousands of Kiwis reported feeling weak rattling as far north as Auckland and as far south as Dunedin. In the capital, it brought sustained shaking for around 15 seconds at 7.53am NZST. The earthquake was 37km deep according to seismic monitoring agency GMS Science. Ardern was being interviewed in the executive government building, known as the Beehive, live on television channel Three, when the quake hit.

If you see things moving behind me,” she said. The camera shot shakes as Ardern looks around to judge her safety. “The Beehive moves a little more than most. “It’s just stopped. No, we’re fine. I’m not under any hanging lights, I look like I’m in a structurally sound place.” Elsewhere, the immediate damage seemed minor. Quite the shake in Wairarapa #eqnz I hope everyone else is OK. pic.twitter.com/amDDRnPlrn New Zealand lies on the seismically active “Ring of Fire”, a 40,000km arc of volcanoes and ocean trenches girdling much of the Pacific Ocean. The National Emergency Management Agency quickly ruled out the threat of tsunami. A Wellington councillor, Fleur Fitzsimons, reported a strange coincidence during the rumble. “Eek, on the phone to the mayor talking about earthquake strengthening the Central Library when that earthquake hit! #eqnz #Wellington,” she wrote on Twitter.
