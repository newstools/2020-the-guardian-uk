The actor died suddenly while at home with his wife on Saturday, his agent said. Angelis lent his voice to the children’s TV programme for 13 series, taking over from Ringo Starr in 1991, when the programme was called Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. He was best known to adult audiences for his role as Arnie in September Song, Martin Niarchos in GBH, Lucien Boswell in The Liver Birds and as Mickey Startup in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. He also made appearances in Casualty, The Bill, Holby City and Heartbeat. Born in Liverpool, Angelis first appeared on screen in the 1970s in programmes such as Z Cars, Thirty-Minute Theatre and an episode of Coronation Street, before stints in Minder, World’s End and Boys from the Blackstuff. He was married to Coronation Street actress Helen Worth, who plays Gail Platt, from 1991 to 2001, and later married Jennifer Khalastchi.
