The dangers facing Boris Johnson as he tries to manoeuvre the country out of lockdown are starkly illustrated by Monday morning’s front pages featuring the prime minister’s heavily caveated statement to the nation. Four days after many newspapers looked forward to a widespread easing of restrictions on “Magic Monday”, the story was very different following Sunday’s night’s televised address to the nation. “Boris keeps handbrake on”, says the Mail’s front page headline alongside a large picture of the prime minister clenching his fist as he makes a point during the broadcast. It says Johnson set out the “first steps to free Britain”.

However, the broadsheet also carries a front page commentary which says that the prime minister “gave us the map, but only a few vague directions”.

The Metro invokes the prime minister’s fondness for the classics by saying “It’s all Greek to us Boris” while the Guardian says “PM’s lockdown release leaves Britain confused and divided”. The Mirror says “Lockdown Britain: it’s chaos”.

The Scotsman says “Stay at home remains as PM faces backlash”, while the Herald carries the warning from first minister Nicola Sturgeon: “If we don’t stay at home now, more people will die”.
