This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Ferens Art Gallery, Hull. The Ferens Art Gallery has one of the finest regional art collections in the country. Opened in 1927, the Ferens is one of eight sites that comprise Hull Museums, operated by Hull Culture and Leisure Limited since 2014. Collection strengths include European old masters from the 14th century onwards – especially Netherlandish 17th century, maritime painting and 20th century British art.
