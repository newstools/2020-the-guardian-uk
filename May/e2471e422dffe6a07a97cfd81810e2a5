The NFL has decided to move its international games back to the US for the 2020 season as the sports world deals with the Covid-19 pandemic. The league had scheduled four games in London and one in Mexico City, but they will now be moved back to the stadiums of the host teams. The Jacksonville Jaguars, who have been regular visitors to London in recent years, were the ‘home team’ for two games at Wembley. Meanwhile, the Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons had been the nominal hosts for two games at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. One game had been scheduled for the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, with the Arizona Cardinals as hosts. The away teams were to be decided when the 2020 season schedule is released later this week. “After considerable analysis, we believe the decision to play all our games domestically this season is the right one for our players, our clubs, and all our fans in the US, Mexico and UK,” said NFL executive vice-president, Christopher Halpin. “We greatly appreciate the support of our governmental and stadium partners in Mexico and the United Kingdom, who all agree with this decision, and we look forward to returning for games in both countries in the 2021 season. We also thank our incredible fans in those territories for their passionate support of the NFL.” London has hosted NFL games every year since the International Series started in 2007. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he agreed with the decision to move the games back to the US. “While the NFL’s many fans in London, the UK and Europe will obviously be disappointed by this news, it is absolutely the right decision to ensure the safety of everyone involved in the sport,” said Khan. “I know that the NFL remains fully committed to London and I look forward to welcoming NFL teams back to the capital in 2021.” The NFL has said it still plans to start the regular season on schedule on 10 September.
