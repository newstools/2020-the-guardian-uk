This 2017 co-production by Zest Theatre and Half Moon was created in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, and draws on countless conversations with Britain’s young people. But this subtle two-hander (now available to watch online) isn’t really about Brexit. With a sparse set and the young audience scattered among the action, What Once Was Ours is about what unites us – and how shared experiences and emotions might bring us together. Set in small-town England, the play focuses on half-siblings Callum (Jaz Hutchins) and Katie (Pippa Beckwith), who have been estranged for years; while they share a dad, that’s where the similarities end. Callum has grown up with a loving mum; Katie can’t remember the last time her mother said, “I love you.” Both are angry, frightened and lonely. The script has been devised by the company and is dynamic but uneven. The pointed references to Brexit feel dated and the conversation between the reunited siblings, despite sympathetic performances from Hutchins and Beckwith, can sound clunky. It’s the bits in between the main dialogue that speak most powerfully – particularly the vox-pop voiceovers, which contain startlingly honest comments from a wide range of young people. Even better is the unspoken communication between the actors and audience, underpinned by Guy Connelly’s gently massaging soundtrack. As Callum and Katie fight, talk and tentatively become friends, the actors weave among the audience, tapping their shoulders, making eye contact and sharing a smile. The beauty of this recorded version is that the audience’s reactions become a pivotal part of the production, as we watch the young crowd laugh, gasp and cringe as one.
