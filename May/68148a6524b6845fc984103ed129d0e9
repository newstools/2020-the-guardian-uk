The Leaver/Remainer gap was huge but in this pandemic what recently seemed like the Grand Canyon of divides now feels … oh so very last year. But new divisions have sprung up. This year it’s all about those with gardens versus the rest, unsurprisingly, given that access to outdoor space makes a huge difference to experiences of lockdown. There’s a very good reason why use of parks is up 16%, according to Google – and that was before we lifted the mother of all lockdown restrictions and let people sunbathe. The Office for National Statistics has done some interesting digging on this front from Ordnance Survey maps. The headline result is that one in eight of us does not have access to a private or shared garden. Regionally, London has the dubious honour of having by far the most gardenless households: one in five. Second place goes to Scotland, where one in eight (13%) of households do without. The gaps between ethnic groups are staggering. Black people are nearly four times more likely to have to do without outside space. The good news? Access to parks is higher in the more deprived areas of the UK. There is less good news for those living in Clapham: 46,000 Londoners have Clapham Common as their nearest park. Good luck with social distancing there this weekend. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. Read more at resolutionfoundation.org
