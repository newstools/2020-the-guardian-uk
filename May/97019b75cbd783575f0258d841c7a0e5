This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, home to an impressive collection of art and sculpture. Its exhibition programme brings the biggest names in historic, modern and contemporary art to the the north-east. The Laing’s collection includes landscapes by John Martin, sculpture by Henry Moore, wood carvings by Gerrard Robinson and works by Turner, Gauguin and Stanley Spencer.
