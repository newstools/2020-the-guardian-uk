Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I haven’t booked anything at all for the summer and have no idea whether I should. Is it even too late to get a cottage or a pitch at a campsite? What are other readers doing? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
