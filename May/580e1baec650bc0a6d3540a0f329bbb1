This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the National Gallery in London, which houses one of the greatest collections of paintings in the world. It contains over 2,300 works and represents all major western European painting traditions, with works by Van Eyck, Raphael, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Turner, Rembrandt, Degas, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Monet, Rubens, Velázquez and Titian. These pictures belong to the public and entrance to see them is free. You can see art from the National Gallery on Art UK here. Find out more on the National Gallery website here.
