Your editorial (The Guardian view on Covid-19 and care homes: promises are not enough, 28 April) is incomplete. As with almost everything else I’ve read about Covid-19, one group has been ignored. When will someone notice the thousands of care workers, mainly women, who continue to visit and look after people living in their own homes? They are exposed to as many, if not more, risks of infection and seem to be at the end of the line when PPE is provided, yet are getting little, if any, recognition. And what about the district nurses?Jennifer HewittWendover, Buckinghamshire • Joel Golby’s comparison of Covid-19 with the Black Death (Opinion, theguardian.com, 27 April) seems a little facile. The Black Death killed 30-60% of Europe’s population, affecting all age groups similarly. Covid-19 appears to kill 0.2-0.8% of the people it infects, the great majority towards the end of their lives. This is not sufficient to create the boom in graveyards he imagines.Simon WoodProfessor of statistical science, University of Bristol • It’s not just Ottolenghi: despite having just had my first large grocery delivery since January, I don’t even have the ingredients for most of your £2 lunches (In a lunch rut? 25 delicious £2 dishes to help you escape it – from quiche to quesadillas, 30 April).Angela LansleyLiverpool • Sarah Moss suggests women and children leave lockdown first while men stay at home baking banana bread and clapping (Letters, 30 April).
