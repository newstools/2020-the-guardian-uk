During a pandemic that has seen more than 70,000 deaths in the US (almost a quarter of the global amount), there is probably no worse song the president could walk out to than Live and Let Die, a cover by the rock band Guns N’ Roses. But these are strange times, and so as Donald Trump walked around an N95 mask manufacturing plant in Phoenix, Arizona, that’s exactly what happened. The president was, of course, not wearing a mask. He never does. Even when standing next to a bin full of hundreds of masks, in a mask manufacturing factory, he still managed not to wear one. And so, watching a clip of Trump being told how the mask works to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, it’s hard not to imagine he is off somewhere in his head, thinking about what he’s going to have for his dinner (that would be fries). “Thats great, that’s great,” says Trump, as a Honeywell employee describes how the mask traps air particles. “How many do you make a day, Ryan?” he asks, breathing all over the bin full of masks. They blasted “Live and Let Die” while Trump walked around a Honeywell plant today in Arizona without a mask. It’s hard to believe this clip is real. pic.twitter.com/M1dMe8KaMK Then comes his movie moment. As if to let us know what’s been going on inside Trump’s head all this time, the song begins to blast: If this ever-changin’ world In which we live in Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die …” Jimmy Kimmel couldn’t help but notice a metaphor in the moment. I can think of no better metaphor for this presidency than Donald Trump not wearing a face mask to a face mask factory while the song “Live and Let Die” blares in the background. pic.twitter.com/mJzU1HW7HA But the incident left some thinking Trump may have just found his 2020 election slogan. Finally, an appropriate slogan.Trump 2020: Live and Let Die #LALD https://t.co/PPsMGQOGbY Then, theories began circulating about the person who decided to play that song at that moment. Some thought it was Trump’s idea. Others put it down to a moment of pure genius. Whoever had the balls to play Live and Let Die while Trump toured the mask factory can deejay any party I ever have for the rest of my life. https://t.co/PQv6gT5p5F Others, meanwhile, imagined the explanation to be a touch more serendipitous. I know people see this as some small act of rebellion, and maybe it was, but it's just as likely they were listening to some "all rock, less talk" station called, like, 105.7 KROQ, THE BONE and it just happened to come on. https://t.co/1OweNiPZAU We are yet to find out whether the soundtrack for Trump’s Honeywell visit was approved by the plant or Guns N’ Roses. The Guardian was redirected to the White House after contacting Honeywell for comment, meanwhile, Guns N’ Roses representatives are yet to respond. Guns N’ Roses’ frontman, Axl Rose, once requested that Trump stop playing their songs at his rallies. But then again, Rose has been vocal about his dismay over Trump’s response to the pandemic – so perhaps he’ll be pleased his lyrics at least made Trump look like an idiot this time round. Q: If the Sheriffs can choose not to enforce the beach closures can the hospitals “choose” not to admit any possible Covid-19 suspected beach goers? Just askin’...🤔 Trump, of course, tweeted out his own video from the visit, sans metaphorical music but full of masked workers surrounding an administration that just doesn’t seem to care. Thank you @Honeywell! pic.twitter.com/4jH6NF63XI Live and let die, I guess.
