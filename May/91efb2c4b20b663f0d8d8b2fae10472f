Production of the world’s longest-running cartoon has been interrupted by the coronavirus, forcing the broadcast of re-runs for the first time in decades. Sazae-san, a mainstay of the Japanese weekend that first aired in 1969, revolves around a typical Tokyo family consisting of Mrs Sazae, who lives with her parents, husband, son, brother and sister. The 30-minute episodes broadcast on Sunday nights are very popular, and for many in Japan have come to denote the end of the weekend. But the cartoon, recognised as the longest-running animated TV series by Guinness World Records, has been hampered by the outbreak of the virus, with animation dubbing halted to keep staff safe, broadcaster Fuji Television Network said. “We will halt broadcast of new episodes of Sazae-san for the time being from May 17 and instead air re-runs,” it announced on Sunday. The network said upcoming broadcasts would be episodes from two years ago, adding it would announce a date for the resumption of new episodes as soon as possible. It is the first time the network has been forced to air re-runs since 1975, when the economic effects of an earlier oil crisis lingered. Japan has recorded 15,777 coronavirus cases and 624 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The country is under a state of emergency that was extended last week until the end of May, though the government is considering lifting the measures earlier in parts of the country.
