This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Imperial War Museums. IWM’s exceptional collection is one of the most important representations of 20th-century British art in the world. It includes many great artworks from the British government war art schemes of the first and second world wars. IWM continues to commission artists and the collection reflects recent and contemporary conflicts included in paintings, posters, sculpture and much more. You can see art from Imperial War Museums on Art UK here. Find out more on the Imperial War Museums website here.
