A survey has suggested that more than 300,000 in the UK may have quit smoking during the coronavirus crisis. But while there is well-established evidence that smoking harms the immune system and our ability to fight off infections, there are also reports suggesting that smokers could be less likely to get Covid-19 due to the effect of nicotine. We would like to hear from current and recent smokers about their tobacco consumption during the pandemic. Have you stopped smoking? Have you started smoking or wearing nicotine patches? Are you trying to stop smoking? Are you concerned that smokers may be more vulnerable to the virus or perhaps better protected as some reports suggest?
