I’ve been spending my lockdown watching 90 Day Fiancé (TLC) with my partner. It’s very exciting, humorous and real. I love that the couples have never met each other before but are prepared to get married almost straight away – it’s such a simple but entertaining premise. They are all just random people from all over the world trying to make love work, which as most people know is not easy. Trying to fall in love with somebody you have never met in your life is almost impossible so all the couples are fascinating to watch. At the end of the day, very few of them make it. It’s a lesson to all of us to find someone who really knows you, because if there is distance in a marriage it just won’t function. As much as it is very funny and the couples have lots of arguments though, this is real life and it is often how marriages are. A marriage can be full of disagreements, or it might be that you don’t have love and you only got married because you were looking for something. It is almost educational for myself and my partner, since I have been married once and divorced, so when you go into it a second time, you want to make sure you know what you want. I have been living in Nigeria for 14 years now, ever since I finished presenting Gladiators. So as well as 90 Day Fiancé, I also watch some of the local TV, including my own show here, which is Deal or No Deal. I started presenting the Nigerian version at the same time as Noel did in the UK. It is massively popular and I watch myself to make sure I’m getting better at what I do. It is so lovely to see people who are not affluent suddenly come into money on the show – when you see that look on their faces and they are crying, it is almost impossible to not get emotional myself. We are helping them to have a new start in life and that really is the best feeling in the world. Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins is on Channel 4, Mondays at 9pm.
