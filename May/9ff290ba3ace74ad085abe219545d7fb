Two teenagers discovered malnourished and naked by police in a suburban Brisbane home on Wednesday are being treated in hospital. According to reports, police had been responding to the sudden death of a 49-year-old man when they found the male teenagers, aged 17 and 19, after hearing sounds from within a locked bedroom. Guardian Australia understands that the 49-year-old was the father of the pair. A Queensland Ambulance spokesman told the Guardian that responders had been called to an address in Stafford in Brisbane’s north about 7.20am on Wednesday, after police had arrived on scene: “They were both in stable conditions, and are now being treated in hospital for medical conditions they suffered.” The spokesman said they were being treated at Prince Charles hospital. The Guardian understands the 49-year-old’s death is not being treated suspiciously by authorities but a postmortem examination is being conducted. Di Farmer, Queensland’s minister for child safety, has described the situation as “horrific” and said her “thoughts are with these two young men who are getting the support and care they need”. “Hearing about events like this in our community is never easy,” she said. Steven Miles, the deputy premier, said he had only learned about the discovery from media reports, but said what he’d seen was “particularly tragic” and “heart-wrenching”.
