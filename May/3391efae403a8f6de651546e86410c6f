Reading and Leeds festival, the two-city weekender that is one of the UK’s biggest outdoor events, has been cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis. Organisers of the festival said: “We were hopeful we could deliver the ultimate festival to you in August … however it has become clear it is just not possible.” Ticket holders can choose to have a refund or roll their ticket over to 2021’s event. The festival had been due to host headliners Stormzy, Rage Against the Machine and Liam Gallagher over the August bank holiday weekend. A total of 195,000 people attend the two events, which feature the same lineup of artists. As one of the last events to run in the festival season, its cancellation looks likely to mean that no festivals will go ahead at all this summer. Glastonbury, Trnsmt and Latitude are among those to have already been cancelled. Major music festivals to have not yet announced their cancellation include Creamfields, Green Man and End of the Road.
