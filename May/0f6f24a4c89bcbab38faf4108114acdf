The head of La Liga, Javier Tebas, has said there will be matches played every day in Spain until the season is completed on 19 July – but organisers have so far released dates for only the first two rounds of fixtures. All 20 teams in the league have 11 matches to play. Tebas has also given details of a planned tribute to the victims of the pandemic, with audio recordings of fan applause transmitted into each stadium and broadcast on TV in the 20th minute of each game. “Fans make football so special, and as they cannot be in the stadiums we have created this initiative so they can play a part in the return of the competition and show their support for the heroes of Covid-19,” Tebas told the Spanish TV network Movistar. “We want them to feel close to their clubs even though they will be in the stadiums making noise,” Tebas added. “This way, the players will also be able to hear the support of their fans.”
