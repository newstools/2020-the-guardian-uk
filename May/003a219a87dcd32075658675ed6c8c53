In 1968-69 John Tooley was founding chair of the Dramatic and Lyric Theatre Association (DALTA), whose aim was to revitalise touring in Britain when neither the National nor the RSC did that. He invited the Oxford Playhouse and the fledgling Prospect theatre company to contribute the drama alongside Sadler’s Wells Opera and the Royal Ballet. When I told him that one venue wanted eight performances of Richard II rather than the offered split involving Marlowe’s Edward II, he replied: “If they don’t want your Edward they can’t have my Swan Lake. Next item.” Three days later the manager concerned rang to tell me he would take both.
