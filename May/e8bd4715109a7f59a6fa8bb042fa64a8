A fire at a hospital in St Petersburg has killed coronavirus patients who had been attached to ventilators. A source in Russia’s emergencies ministry source said five patients had died and 150 were evacuated after the blaze broke out early on Tuesday morning on the sixth floor of St George hospital. The building had been repurposed to treat Covid-19 victims, Tass news agency reported, and the patients who died had been connected to ventilators. RIA Novosti news agency quoted an emergency services spokesman as saying the fire appeared to have been caused by an electrical malfunction, while Interfax cited a source saying it was an “overload” with ventilators being “pushed to their limit”. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which examines serious crimes, said it had launched an inquiry into the incident. A fire at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients last week killed one person and forced hundreds to evacuate. Investigators were also examining the cause of two deadly fires at residence homes in Moscow. Russia has confirmed more than 220,000 coronavirus cases and ranks fourth in a global tally of total infections after the US, Spain and Britain.
