Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff are to take part in an event to raise money for coronavirus charities. The foursome will play in the TaylorMade Driving Relief – a two-team skins challenge over 18 holes – at Seminole in Florida on 17 May. McIlroy, the world No 1, will team up with Johnson against Fowler and Wolff, with up to $3m (£2.38m) going to the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation. All four will follow strict physical-distancing measures and comprehensive testing will be used to protect players, TV staff and others at the course. The challenge will be broadcast live simultaneously in the United States and the UK. “We are excited about the safe and responsible return of live golf and the opportunity to raise significant funds for those on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan. “With four of the PGA Tour’s top stars in Rory, Rickie, Dustin and Matthew participating, golf fans around the world can look forward to a unique, interactive and entertaining event that will help those in need.” There have been 13 events cancelled or postponed on the PGA Tour owing to Covid-19, with the tour set to resume on 8 June at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas. European Tour players are to compete in the BMW Indoor Invitational, a virtual tournament using the latest simulator technology. Martin Kaymer, Joost Luiten, Mike Lorenzo-Vera, Lee Westwood and Bernd Wiesberger will take part.
