The Schalke midfielder Weston McKennie took to the pitch for Saturday’s Bundesliga game with Werder Bremen wearing an armband reading “Justice for George”, the African-American whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police has led to protests across the United States. After the match McKennie tweeted: “To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on to long feels good!!! We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard! #justiceforgeorgefloyd #saynotoracism.” To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on to long feels good!!!

The 21-year-old McKennie is a USA international from Fort Lewis, Washington, but had three years as a child in Kaiserslautern. When his family returned to the States it was to Texas, where he played for FC Dallas before joining Schalke in 2016.
