Morag Watkins (Letters, 1 May) is absolutely right to say that this government is keeping its strategy secret because it doesn’t have one. As the owner of a holiday home in Crete, I have just received a detailed statement by email of how the restrictions will be eased and the economy allowed to slowly reopen in Crete. Each stage is described, with details of who can do what and when. From my own government here – nothing!Mary RogersMartock, Somerset • I’m confused. We were hailed as heroes for staying at home. We’re now denounced as cowards for refusing to go back to work without a shred of safety. Most employers cannot have anything resembling social distancing at work. They are swerving their duty of care in these special circumstances.Derek McMillanDurrington, West Sussex • Judging by the surge in traffic flowing along the A27 Eastbourne to Brighton road this week, I fear people have decided to take the timing of the government’s plans for lifting the lockdown into their own hands (Report, 4 May). Perhaps a case of herd instinct swamping herd immunity.Sam WhiteLewes, East Sussex
