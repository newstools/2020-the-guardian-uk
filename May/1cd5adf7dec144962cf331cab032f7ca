There could not be a better time to support small presses and new voices in poetry by buying their books and pamphlets. The poet and visual artist Ella Frears’ new collection is a Poetry Book Society recommendation for this summer. We may yet find ourselves performing some of the beautifully strange, moon-driven actions of her haunting poem. New Moon:               I ransacked the house for something that does not exist.Waxing Crescent:   I ate twelve peaches. First Quarter:           I Tipp-Exed an old letter from him, leaving only the word basement.Waxing Gibbous:    I put on my favourite underwear and cried in the mirror. Full Moon:                I buried a pork-chop in the garden, walked backwards, howled.Waning Gibbous:    I thought a great deal about drilling a hole in my head. Third Quarter:         I told the neighbour my heart beats only for her. Waning Crescent:   I stood outside facing the house, waited for myself to appear. • From Shine, Darling (Offord Road Books, 2020).
