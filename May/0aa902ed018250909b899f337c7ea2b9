Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 lb (501 kg) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland. Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane on Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500kg. .@ThorBjornsson_ HAS DONE IT!He just deadlifted 1,104 pounds, setting a new world record 😮💪 #TheOcho pic.twitter.com/YQzO5ULZ3S The 31-year-old Bjornsson, 31, completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight. “I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” Bjornsson said. “I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they were happy with this, and I’ve decided to call it.” Bjornsson, who is 6ft 9in and weighs 452 lb (205 kg), won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018.
