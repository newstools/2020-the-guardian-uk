I am very grateful to your country for producing The Great British Bake Off. I have discovered it during the quarantine and I don’t know how I lived my life without it. We binged the last three seasons as a family and we can’t get enough. I don’t watch a ton of television so this has been the first time I’ve been able to catch up on things people have recommended, such as Killing Eve, Fleabag and now Bake Off. My mother is British so I grew up watching BBC productions on Masterpiece Theatre, Agatha Christie’s Poirot and a lot of other British shows. I’m always excited about whatever you guys are making over there. The contestants on Bake Off are really next level, though. They have inspired me to make different things for my family, now I have the time and am having to cook three meals a day – although I don’t think I could ever get to their standards of presentation, especially with all these distractions. I really like Prue Leith. She is somebody who seems to really enjoy tasting food, not just eating it. So if she tastes something that she likes, she gets tickled by it, she gets all bright and bubbly and you can just tell that it’s her joy to taste the perfect flavour combination – her enthusiasm is infectious. Her funky glasses and earring combinations are also delightful. What I maybe enjoy the most about it though, compared with US competitions, is that all the competitors are so kind. They really root for each other and there’s this camaraderie. They seem so invested in their successes and so excited to create something delicious. It’s more about that than any sort of prize; there isn’t even a big money reward at the end. That’s something we could do with more of at the moment. Stumptown is on Alibi, Wednesdays at 9pm
