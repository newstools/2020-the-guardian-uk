After losing his father and younger sister in recent years, photographer Simon Bray has an appreciation of what it feels like to lose someone close to you, and through his photography project Loved&Lost, he offers the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate those who are no longer with us.If you have lost someone through coronavirus and would like to take part, we’d like to hear from you. We would like you to send in a family photograph that you would be happy to restage, so that you can return to the place where it was taken with Simon to re-take it (while observing physical distancing). We are particularly looking for people based in the Greater Manchester area. Please note that unlike the Loved&Lost project, Simon won’t be conducting interviews, simply taking photographs.
