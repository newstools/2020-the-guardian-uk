McDonalds is to open sites in Gillingham, Chelmsford, London and Luton – for takeaway only – after nearly two months of closure. The company will take the temperature of every employee using contactless thermometers at the start of each shift when the 15 sites reopen on 13 May. Other locations include Ipswich, Sittingbourne and Watford. The stores will open for fewer hours with a smaller number of workers than usual, and will offer a limited menu, which has been updated to include additional vegetarian options, including the Vegetable Deluxe burger. The UK and Ireland chief executive, Paul Pomroy, said the company had trialled the new safety measures and the service would not be same as before. McDonald’s joins a group of fast food outlets and coffee shop chains, including Nando’s, Burger King and Pret a Manger, to start phased reopenings during the Covid-19 lockdown. On Wednesday, TGI Fridays said it would reopen 24 of its 87 restaurants for takeaways – including a new service that enables clients to order online and pick it up from the restaurant. The Caribbean restaurant chain Turtle Bay, which has 44 outlets around the country, is reopening four for takeaway only – including in Bristol and Nottingham – while Deep Blue, part of the Harry Ramsden’s group, is to open one outlet in Havant, Hampshire, to test out a delivery-only model. The reopenings come as restaurant groups attempt to find a way to survive with physical distancing measures, which could remain in place for months.
