Johnson is squirming, shuffling papers and looking totally out of his depth ... He is definitely out of his comfort zone without his baying crowd behind him. Bikergaz Oh that was wonderful. Starmer just feeding more and more rope to Johnson. And now Johnson having Blackford to contend with, marvellous. funkymentalist Starmer is asking the right questions and responding well but he can’t nail Johnson, who seems totally unphased by anything Starmer raises. It is all bluster and deflection but Johnson is still bouncing. They need someone much harder. ManuelSantiago If this was a boxing match, the referee would have stopped it. mrdroberts Starmer appears to have raised his game today. Hopefully this will continue in the coming months. FirstWorlder Good performance from both leaders so far today. So refreshing compared to the desperate May v Corbyn PMQs! zambooka Starmer was ‘fine’ at PMQs and Johnson was completely floundering, but Starmer should honestly have attacked harder. Corbyn was so often criticised of not pressing the advantage; Starmer is repeating the same error! gbrading The PM at PMQ is talking absolute rubbish. Real rubbish. It doesn’t make any sense. Complete word salad. It is terrible. Challenge blah blah ramp up blah plan blah blah billions blah blah. jenniwrenbird I am really surprised how poor Johnson is when speaking live. It is hard for him to come up with two or three logical sentences. Starmer is wiping the floor with him. IdioticPanda Starmer having to answer his own question in the absence of an answer. Nice technique, very nice … StuffnBalls Johnson having to concede that Keir Starmer “is quite right” several times. Just like Raab, he is struggling badly with Starmer’s attention to detail and use of government data to challenge him. rustledust74 Johnson doesn’t sound as convincing in an empty room. Need’s the jeering mob to surf in on. gbru2505
