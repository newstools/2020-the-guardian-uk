Fiona Harveyâ€™s obituary of Sir John Houghton reminded me of the humility of this distinguished scientist. After meeting Sir John at a Welsh government event, I tentatively wrote to him asking if he would address a public meeting in my local town of Narberth in Pembrokeshire. To my surprise and delight he responded positively. A few weeks later, we greeted Sir John, who had travelled from his home in North Wales, and walked to the Queens Hall, where the Weight Watchers group was clearing up, having just finished their session. On seeing this, Sir John promptly grabbed hold of a broom to help and then happily joined us in setting out the seating for the meeting.
