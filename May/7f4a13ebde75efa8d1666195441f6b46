Virgin Atlantic plans to cut the jobs of more than 3,000 workers and shut its operations at Gatwick airport in the latest sign of the chaos caused in the airline industry by coronavirus. The 3,150 planned redundancies represent almost a third of Virgin Atlantic’s workforce of 10,000. Airlines across the world have been rocked by the grounding of flights during pandemic lockdowns, which have put their business models in jeopardy. Virgin Atlantic’s job cuts come after British Airways announced plans to shed 12,000 jobs. Virgin said it could take three years for flight numbers to return to 2019 levels, and that it had to cut jobs to survive. Sir Richard Branson, the airline’s founder, has asked for a bailout but the UK government is unwilling to provide a separate package for airlines beyond the help offered to all businesses. Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, said: “To safeguard our future and emerge a sustainably profitable business, now is the time for further action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and to protect as many jobs as possible. It is crucial that we return to profitability in 2021. “After 9/11 and the global financial crisis we took similar painful measures, but fortunately many members of our team were back flying with us within a couple of years. “Depending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time.”
