The poet Lachlan Mackinnon lives in Ely, and is also a distinguished critic and former teacher. Music, of all kinds, has always been important to his poetry, alongside a healing journeying towards faith. A psalmist (notably David in the Old Testament) is a composer of sacred lyrics, and sometimes poems can share this territory. The writer’s epiphany in this poem answers our own need for such moments of consolation. When I look upmy soul is water, ittrembles beneath your breathas the skin of a mountain poolshakes below whistled cloud. Where there is musiclet each voice praise you,clashing cymbalsunleash their roaringwhisper, the strings sing at one with braided voicesof boys and girls, and let the harpistbow her sweetneck to the sweet burdenof an air plucked from air, the trumpeter braywhat you have promised,that you will move among usto bind each wound,that all things shall be made good. • From Doves, published by Faber, 2017.
