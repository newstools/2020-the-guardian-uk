The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared a rare public glimpse of their son, Archie, marking his first birthday on Wednesday with a video of him enjoying one of his favourite books, Duck! Rabbit! The footage, shot by Harry during the lockdown birthday celebrations, showed Meghan cradling Archie, and was posted on Save the Children UK’s Instagram page in support of its coronavirus campaign to raise funds for children and families struggling in the pandemic. Filmed in Los Angeles, where the couple now live under California’s “stay-at-home” guidelines, the short film reveals Meghan’s nickname for her son is “Arch”. He is seen grabbing at pages, and at one point impatiently reaches for another book, prompting his mother to say: “Let’s finish this book first, then we’ll have that book.” Archie has been seen on few occasions, with his parents keen to guard his privacy. The first publicly-released footage was on the couple’s tour of southern Africa last year, when he was introduced to the anti-apartheid campaigner archbishop Desmond Tutu. The video is in support of the charity’s Save with Stories campaign, with several celebrities taking part. A caption on the charity’s Instagram site read: “Duck! Rabbit! with Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex (and Harry, The Duke of Sussex behind the camera), read to their son Archie for his 1st birthday. Happy Birthday, Archie! “Thank you Duchess Meghan for helping us to raise urgent funds for our coronavirus appeal by reading Duck! Rabbit!”
