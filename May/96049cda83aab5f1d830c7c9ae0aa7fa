Anticipation is building among New Zealanders as an easing of the strict coronavirus lockdown rules approaches, but not everyone is relishing the prospect of re-entering society after months confined to their homes. New Zealand has been in a stringent lockdown for seven weeks and on Thursday most restrictions will be loosened, allowing people to go back to work and school, to shop, eat in restaurants and go to the cinema, playground or library. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her “team of 5 million” sacrificed normality to protect the nation’s most vulnerable people – including the elderly and immunosuppressed – but now restrictions can begin to loosen as health authorities gain control of the disease. The country reported no new cases or deaths on Tuesday. While many are relishing the prospect of resuming their normal lives – and economists are sighing with relief that the economy can kick back into life – a small sense of anxiety is growing among some at what will be a very altered version of New Zealand’s “normal”. Strangers are being asked to keep their distance from one another, and social gatherings are capped at 10. Many workplaces and public transport will operate in shifts to satisfy social distancing requirements, and up to a third of small businesses may be forced to close their doors for good, unable to recover from the lockdown. Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, said for many, fears of catching the virus may flare up with the loosened restrictions, while others may feel they have become rusty when it comes to basic social skills such as friendships, dating and interacting with colleagues. My feels are very weird about Level 2 because my social anxiety is having a massive flare up. Gently reminding myself that I don’t even have that many friends, and no one wants to hang out with me anyway 😂😬 “The announcement of moving to Level 2 will bring a sense of relief for many. However, for a significant number the return to work and school may bring about a return of worry and anxiety,” Sutherland said. “Despite the obvious downsides, Levels 3 and 4 did bring a sense of protection and security for some who suffer from anxiety. As we emerge from the shadows of strict lockdown old fears about becoming unwell may reappear. Triggers for anxiety that have lain dormant for weeks, such as the fear of social evaluation by others, may arise again.” With many having lost their jobs or been forced to take pay cuts, Level 2 may also drive home the stark reality of the social and economic consequences of the pandemic, Sutherland said. “Breaking out of our bubbles may bring with it feelings of loss, shame, and guilt as we come face-to-face with these harsh realities and have to front up to others.” Ardern has urged Kiwis to think of Level 2 as “the new normal”; an idea Dr Hiran Thabrew a child psychiatrist and paediatrician at the University of Auckland, agrees with. Thabrew said if expectations were too high, some people could struggle with the ongoing requirements for social distancing and stringent hygiene practices. “We are not going back to business as usual,” associate professor Bernard Walker of the business and law school at the University of Canterbury said. “We may be only nanoseconds away from the chaos and grief overseas.” Anxiety about returning to life post-lockdown is a global experience, with reports of similar feelings emerging among populations in Italy, Spain, France, Australia and the UK.
