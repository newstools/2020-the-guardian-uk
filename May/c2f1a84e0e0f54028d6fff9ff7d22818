Someone should, I feel, point out to Margaret Follon (Letters, 11 May) that, when the England v Scotland match at Wembley was a biennial fixture, we were regularly exhorted by banners displayed by visiting supporters to “Remember Bannockburn”. Wartime nostalgia peculiarly English? Perhaps Ms Follon should resist her own hardwired tendency to generalise.Mike CrispHornchurch, London • I’m keen to go and visit my aged but healthy parents-in-law so I’ve suggested they put their house on the market and I’ll arrange a viewing (Housing market is allowed to restart, 12 May). Sorted.Philip DaviesLondon • Many thanks to Steve Bell who has finally shown me a picture of a lert (If…, G2, 13 May). For many years we have all been told to “Keep a Lert”: Britain needs lerts, and at last I shall now recognise one when I see it. Keep up the good work!Alan ThwaitesBridgnorth, Shropshire • Re uses for tights (Letters, 12 May), when the fan belt on my friend’s elderly car broke 15 miles from home I was persuaded to part with the tights I was wearing to be used as a substitute. It worked.Dr Brigid PurcellNorwich • Down at the allotment we have been using old tights to store onions for years. Quicker and easier than forming onion ropes.Barry and Joy NormanDrighlington, Leeds • Tights also make good earpieces for fabric masks. Cut each leg into one-inch slices, pull each slice and it will roll into a soft, stretchy band.Hilary CashmanNorton, County Durham
