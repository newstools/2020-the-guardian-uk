How does Sunday start? With a coffee at 8am in our tiny garden. Right now, Sunday mornings aren’t wildly different to other days, except I don’t have to negotiate with my partner, Tanya – a writer, also dependent on video calls – over who’ll get the only room with good internet. Do you work? I normally have so much to do on the weekend: reading, catching up on emails, preparing for speeches or rehearsals. Closing down the theatre, furloughing everyone, planning how we’ll adapt and survive while being in the mass-gathering business has been so intensive that I’m trying to be more disciplined in taking time off. Now it feels essential. What does Sunday feel like? Solitude, it’s usually a rare commodity. My life is extraordinarily full of people: public-facing events, meetings and performances. I recently started mudlarking. I love history, and time spent looking at crap on the Thames foreshore alone is therapeutic. I’ve found seven sets of false teeth, including an 18th-century pair. Everyone thinks it’s disgusting. What are you doing instead of working? Carpentry in the garden, building structures to keep squirrels and foxes away from my kale and tomato plants. They don’t provide much food, but growing them is comforting. If I go past a skip when I take a walk, I’ll grab whatever wood I can. What we do in theatre is so ephemeral that I’m finding doing something tangible quite pleasing. Do you exercise? I like to dance on Sunday evenings. Tonya and I go to 5rhythms classes, and we have been joining Zoom events in lockdown. It’s creative and freeing, helping me lose my inhibitions. It’s far less formal than the line dancing I used to do with my mum. If you could be anywhere next Sunday? Tonya is from St Monans, a small village near Fife. Her family is there; it’s where we got married. That’s where I’d really love to be. I’d be up early and straight into the sea to go swimming.
