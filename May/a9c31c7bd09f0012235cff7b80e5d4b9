Hello and welcome to the final watchalong episode of the first series of Spooks. My apologies for missing so much due to health reasons; thanks again to Jack Seale for doing such a fantastic job standing in for me. This is the one in which the personal really does become political as Tom moves into Ellie’s house, bringing all manner of trouble with him – we all knew that IT cover was going to collapse sometime … We are also back in old-school terrorism mode: Lorcan Cranitch guest stars as the leader of an IRA splinter group with some interesting information. Given all that, and the fact it is a season finale, what could possibly go wrong? Join me in the comments below to find out and remember: all speculation is welcome, but no spoilers. • Get ready to hit play at 7pm BST (on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Britbox in the US, where the show is called MI-5)
