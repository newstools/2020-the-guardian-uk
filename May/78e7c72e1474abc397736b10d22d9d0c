The message from the International Cricket Council was clear: no more boiled sweets, but sweat is fine. The cricket committee, which is chaired by the former India spin bowler Anil Kumble, has decided to recommend that the use of saliva to polish a cricket ball should be prohibited for the foreseeable future. By contrast the medical advice is that it is highly unlikely that coronavirus can be transmitted through sweat and the committee saw no need to prohibit the use of sweat to polish the ball. These regulations require bowlers – as well as the designated ball-shiner of every Test team – to change the habits of a lifetime and not to lick their fingers upon receipt of the cricket ball. That could be a hard change to make and the new rules will be tough to police for the umpires since the assumption is that any transgression by the fielding side will be an unwitting one. Hopefully the penalty for offending bowlers will not be so draconian as for running on the pitch after delivering the ball (three strikes and you cannot bowl again in the innings). This measure will be another burden for the umpires, who will experience another change. For the first time since 2002 there will not be “neutral umpires” standing in Test matches. A combination of challenges over international travel, limited commercial flights and mandatory quarantine periods means that the committee has recommended that local match officials be appointed in Test cricket for the time being. So if England can fulfil their ambitions to play the Test series against West Indies and Pakistan in July and August, the likes of Richard Illingworth, Richard Kettleborough and Nigel Llong are likely to stand. There may even be a call to the recently retired Ian Gould.
