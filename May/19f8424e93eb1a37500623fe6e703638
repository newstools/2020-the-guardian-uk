The British Grand Prix is expected to be confirmed for August as part on the Formula One calendar next week. F1 is to shortly announce the opening eight European meetings of the season, of which Silverstone will host two back-to-back races behind closed doors, set for 2 and 9 August. It is understood the calendar is ready to be confirmed subject to the government providing clarity on travel restrictions for the teams. The season is due to begin with two back-to-back races in Austria, the first on 5 July. Silverstone was to follow with two meetings but the 14-day quarantine on entry into the UK forced F1 to reschedule their plans. Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK and the sport is still in discussion with the government over gaining exemptions from the quarantine. The proposed races at Silverstone, one of which will be the British Grand Prix, will still be subject to whether the quarantine rules are to be lifted or F1 being granted an exemption. The Silverstone chief executive, Stuart Pringle, said this week that the circuit was flexible in the dates it could hold the meetings and that it was considering August as part of a potential timeframe. Two days ago the Silverstone Classic meeting which was set to take place on the weekend of 31 July to 2 August was cancelled, freeing up the venue for F1. Hungary is now expected to host the third race in an opening triple-header after Austria on 19 July. Spain is set for 16 August, to follow immediately after Silverstone. Belgium and Italy will conclude Europe’s meetings on 30 August and 6 September, the dates they held on the original calendar. Germany’s Hockenheim remains as a backup option should F1 remain unable to race in the UK.
