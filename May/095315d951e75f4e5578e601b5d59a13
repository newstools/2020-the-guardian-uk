My brother and I have always had quite a difficult relationship, but he cut off contact two years ago. I was suffering from severe anxiety and OCD at the time and he wanted me to travel two hours to meet him. He wanted to tell me in person that he and his wife were expecting a baby – I didn’t know this at the time and was just thinking about getting through each day, so I refused. I tried to reach out over the next few months and sent gifts for his baby. Then, when I got engaged, I called to invite him to our wedding. He never responded. He maintains a relationship with my parents and my sister, but apart from gritted politeness at my sister’s wedding I haven’t seen or heard from him. I am expecting my own child and, although I am happy, it is tinged with sadness at this loss. He clearly has grievances, but I am not sure what they are or how else to address them. Has anybody been through a similar situation? •When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
