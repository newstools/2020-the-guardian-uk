Manchester United have urged supporters to stay away from behind-closed-doors games if the season restarts. The prospect of crowds gathering has been a significant concern for police amid the coronavirus pandemic and such messages from clubs are regarded as important if games are to go ahead, particularly without the use of neutral grounds. “We ask for your co-operation not to travel to any stadiums at which we are playing on matchdays,” United wrote to season-ticket holders. “By supporting from home and following government guidance, you will be playing your part to keep your friends, your family and all United fans safe. This united effort to stay at home will give us the best chance of protecting the health of everyone in our community.” United also confirmed a refund on the remaining home games for season-ticket holders. On Wednesday Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad are due to return to training at their Carrington base, where they will work in small groups that are physically distanced. That was permitted by the Premier League from Tuesday after a vote by the clubs and the hope is to restart matches in mid-June. “We’re all looking forward to getting back on a proper pitch,” Luke Shaw told manutd.com. “Running down at the park is OK, but obviously it isn’t ideal. We had another group call today [Tuesday] when the news was confirmed to us, and you could see how excited the coaches were to be getting back. The players are, of course, but we’ve been able to keep busy with fitness work, while the coaches have been waiting to be able to put their sessions into action. “I’m sure there’ll be some fitness work when we get back, but we’ve all done a lot of running over the last three weeks and now we’re all just itching to do more ball work. The most important thing is getting used to that and it’ll be nice to be able to pass, dribble and get the right feel for the ball again so we can do what we all love.”
