The coronavirus pandemic has hit Europe hard and strained cooperation and solidarity between European countries. Some of that cooperation began with the end of the second world war in May 1945. Back then, European nations had to rebuild after years of catastrophic conflict, loss and economic collapse. Now 75 years on, as Europe tries to recover and rebuild once more, we’d like to hear from younger people all over the continent. How European do you feel? Does the second world war hold any lessons for your generation? Have you personally benefited from European cooperation, for an example an Erasmus scheme, a job or similar? Does the return of nationalism worry you? Has the pandemic made you feel more hopeful or pessimistic about the idea of Europeans working together to resolve issues we all face such as healthcare or the climate crisis?
