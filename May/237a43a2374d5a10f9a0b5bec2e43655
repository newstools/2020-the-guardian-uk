Organised sport will resume in the Netherlands from 1 September, but recreational golf and tennis will be allowed from Monday after Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced an easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures on Wednesday. All sports events had been prohibited until 31 August and Wednesday’s announcement opens the door for various codes to begin planning for a resumption in just over three months. That includes the Dutch football league which can now look ahead to its next season after already cancelling the 2019-20 campaign on 24 April. The Dutch can resume playing golf and tennis from Monday but clubhouses remain closed, Rutte said. “These steps points to a return to a society free of the domination of the virus and gives the Netherlands and sport hope,” said the Dutch Olympic Committee in response to Rutte’s announcement.
