Harry Kane has bought the shirt sponsorship for next season’s Leyton Orient kit. The Tottenham striker, who had his first taste of senior football on loan at Orient in 2011, has taken the front-of-shirt sponsorship for the League Two side’s three kits. The deal has been approved by the Premier League, English Football League and Football Association. Kane has donated the sponsorship to three causes, with the home shirt having a thank you message to “frontline heroes” for their work during the coronavirus pandemic, the away shirt showing Haven House children’s hospice’s logo and the third kit donated to the mental health charity Mind. Orient will give 10% of all shirt sales to Kane’s nominated charities. Kane, who scored five goals in 18 games for Orient, said: “I was born and brought up only at a couple of miles from the stadium and I am really happy to have the opportunity to give back to the club that gave me my first professional start. Very proud to announce that I'm supporting the club that gave me my first pro start and three amazing causes by sponsoring @leytonorientfc's shirts for the 2020/21 season. pic.twitter.com/hTh1M7xNf3 “This also gives me a platform to be able to say a big thank you to the many frontline heroes and charities who provide care and support during these challenging times.” The Orient chief executive, Danny Macklin, said: “We wanted to say thank you for the exceptional hard work and dedication of the frontline heroes and also bring attention to the other charities who have all suffering financial loss due to the pandemic. Thank you, Harry, for your amazing support and generosity – you are a true role model for the modern game.”
