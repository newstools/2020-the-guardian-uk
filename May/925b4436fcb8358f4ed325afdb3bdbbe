An Audience With Billy Connolly (1985). In between jokes you can play “spot the celeb” in the background, and even Ringo is there so it must have been good. The Office: An American Workplace. No wait! The Golden Girls. No wait! Baroness von Sketch Show. No wait! The Trip. No wait! It’s impossible. Carry On Up the Jungle. I haven’t seen it since I was 11, though, and I fear it doesn’t hold up. So instead I am going to say Booksmart. A T-shirt with a big smiley face that said in sequins: “CHEER YOU UP!” Who knew positivity could be so aggressive? A hedgehog made of puff pastry with tinned spaghetti in the middle, so it looked like roadkill the minute you cut into it. Now I think about it, it was less funny and more deeply disturbing. When I was seven, I cut my own hair so that I had a shorter fringe, botched it and the hairdresser had to go the full Linda McCartney/David Bowie in Labyrinth. I was literally the babe with the power. All of us trying to figure out how long two metres is in the queue outside Sainsbury’s, while signalling that that is what we are doing by using our faces to perform “measuring acting”. Discombobulated. And is how everyone is feeling right now. “Knock knock.”“Who’s there?”“Grandad – stop the funeral!”Told to me by Barry Cryer – the only name I like to drop.
