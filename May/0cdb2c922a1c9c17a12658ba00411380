This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter – or RAMM as it is affectionately known – which has been collecting art, artefacts and natural history since the 1860s. The collections tell the story of Exeter and Devon since prehistory, and the region’s connections with people and places around the globe. You can see art from the collection on Art UK here.
