Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Pictures have emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a visit in Michigan. The US president had previously been called a “petulant child” by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of the Ford plant. India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started. The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases – around a 5% increase from yesterday. Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be “widespread”, while its health system has “in effect collapsed”. A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also “almost certainly much higher”. Hong Kong activists have called for citizens to rise up against Bejing’s plans to impose national security legislation in the financial hub. Many believe the plans have reignited the anti-government movement that had lost its focus and dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia has reported 973 new infections – its highest number of daily coronavirus cases – bringing the country’s total cases to 20,162. The figures come as millions of people in the world’s fourth most populous country mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations. The leader of New Zealand’s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern’s soaring popularity. Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September.
