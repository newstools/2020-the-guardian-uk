It was very telling that the footballer Norman Hunter was elected by his peers as the first Player of the Year. While defenders are often overlooked for this honour, hewas recognised by his fellow professionals for his skill, determination and consistently high level of performance, as when the England manager Sir Alf Ramsey selected him ahead of Bobby Moore in the 1973 World Cup qualifier against Poland. He will always be remembered for his commitment to his teammates. After collecting his medal in the 1972 Cup final, Norman declined to join the immediate celebrations, but walked back down from the royal box to help his teammate Mick Jones, who was suffering from a dislocated shoulder, and they climbed the steps together.
