Manchester City Women have appointed the former Wales international Gareth Taylor as manager on a three-year deal. He had been in charge of the men’s under-18 side, having previously overseen the under-16s. Taylor, who played as a striker for the club between 1998 and 2001, replaces Nick Cushing, who himself was promoted from the men’s academy when he took charge of the women’s team in 2013. The assistant manager Alan Mahon stepped up on an interim basis from February until the season was suspended in March, after Cushing departed to become assistant coach at the MLS side New York City FC, which is also part of the City Football Group. A word from our new @ManCityWomen Head Coach!🔵 #ManCity pic.twitter.com/UQXJcvMZF9 “I’m absolutely delighted to have joined Manchester City Women and I’m extremely excited about the challenge ahead with a very talented group of players and staff who have enjoyed a lot of success in recent years,” said the 47-year-old Taylor, who will now be assisted by Mahon. “I’m really honoured to have been appointed to this role and I can’t wait to get started with our preparations for another thrilling and competitive. “I’ve been very fortunate to have worked with some great people within Manchester City and the club’s academy so far, but I’m absolutely relishing my new role within City Football Group and I’ll be giving everything I have to continue Manchester City’s success and growth in the women’s game.” The club’s head of women’s football, Gavin Makel, said: “I’m delighted to welcome Gareth into the role of Manchester City Women’s head coach. Over the last few years, I have been fortunate enough to see first-hand the qualities that Gareth possesses. Not only in terms of his abilities as a coach who develops individuals, but also in the way that he leads, whilst exuberating the values and ethos that we hold dear as a club.” City are awaiting the decision on the outcome of the WSL season after the FA announced the league would end with immediate effect on Monday. The club sit top of the table, one point clear of Chelsea but having played a game more. Should the league be decided by points per game then the south-west London club would be awarded the title ahead of them.
