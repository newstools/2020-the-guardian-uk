Director Nisha Ganatra follows the Emma Thompson-starring comedy Late Night with another film that takes as its jumping-off point the relationship between an ambitious young woman and a successful older one. Dakota Johnson is Maggie, a put-upon PA who dreams of being a music producer; Tracee Ellis Ross is Grace, the demanding star whose career is about to be parked in a cul-de-sac Vegas residency. There’s an engaging romantic subplot also: Maggie sparks with amateur musician David (Kelvin Harrison Jr). But while the on-off romance is a reassuringly familiar piece of plotting, the female relationship is more interesting. Prickly and exacting, but also appreciative and generous, it’s at odds with the All About Eve treachery and rivalry narrative that is the more usual Hollywood angle on this kind of female dynamic. While The High Note doesn’t serve up any real surprises, it’s a pleasant diversion, a sunny, slick production that delivers an upbeat refrain of dreams realised and talent appreciated.
