The projected Tom Cruise space movie that became headline news after both Nasa and Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it in early May appears to be becoming closer to reality after film-maker Doug Liman was reported to be on board as director. Deadline reported that Liman, who has worked with Cruise on action thrillers Edge of Tomorrow and American Made, has written a script and is on the production team as well as directing. No details of the planned film’s content have been released, other than the suggestion by Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, who confirmed news media rumours of the project with his 5 May tweet, that filming would take place aboard the International Space Station. Musk, whose SpaceX company is collaborating with Nasa to stage the US’s first manned space launch since 2011, confirmed his involvement in the project by replying to Bridenstine: “Should be a lot of fun!” Cruise’s films are known for their spectacular stunt work, with the actor himself breaking his ankle in 2017 while filming Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Cruise is working on a seventh Mission: Impossible film, but production has shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.
