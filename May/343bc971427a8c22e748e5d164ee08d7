Beijing has announced plans to push national security laws on Hong Kong that would bypass the semiautonomous territory’s legislature. The legislation would “prevent, stop and punish any act to split the country, subvert state power, organise and carry out terrorist activities and other behaviours that seriously endanger national security”. We want to hear from people in Hong Kong about the situation. What do you think the proposals will mean for Hong Kong? Are you taking part in protests? How do you think you will be personally affected? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.
