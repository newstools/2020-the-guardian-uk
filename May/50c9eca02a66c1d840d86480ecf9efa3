YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. The video service, which is owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS. “Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.” The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, which removed Icke’s page on Friday. Well-known medics and broadcasters including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms. They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which claims Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30m  times. “We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed. “However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content [and] need to be removed.” The CCDH asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms. “Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”
