This flowering cherry tree (Prunus serrulata) in the churchyard of St Peter’s church, Aldborough Hatch, Essex, is very special to me. A bitter cherry tree once stood on that spot all through my childhood. It was there when I joined the church choir as an 11-year-old in 1944. We used to eat the cherries, even though they were bitter, because there was hardly any fruit during the war. About 25 years ago, the bitter cherry tree died. It was cut down and my wife Yvonne and I decided to replace it with a flowering cherry tree. It cost £25. After planting it, we watched that tree grow over the years that followed. Now, I often stand and look at it, especially when it is in full bloom, and I see it every Sunday when I go to the church. Yvonne passed away five years ago. We were married for 57 years. This tree remains a special connection to her: it was she who helped me to plant and nurture a glorious and loving thing of great beauty.
