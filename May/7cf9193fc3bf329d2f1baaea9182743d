Named after a bespoke set of bass speakers made for Larry Levan at New York’s legendary club, Paradise Garage, this takes the classic manhattan in a more esoteric direction with the subtle, vegetal notes of Cynar, the nutty bitters and serving it over ice. 40ml rye whiskey (or bourbon, though that will make the drink a bit sweeter)15ml sweet red vermouth - we use Cocchi di Torino15ml Cynar2 drops black walnut bitters, or Angostura bitters1 maraschino cherry, to garnish5ml maraschino cherry juice (ie, from the jar), to finish Build the drink in a similar style to an old fashioned: take a rocks glass, add half the whiskey, vermouth, Cynar and bitters, fill with ice and stir for five to six seconds. Add the remaining liquids and repeat (this will achieve the dilution needed). Add more ice to fill the glass to the top, add the cherry garnish, drizzle over the cherry juice and drink.
