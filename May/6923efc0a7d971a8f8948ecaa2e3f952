The Bundesliga is keen to press ahead with plans to restart the season for the top two tiers next weekend, despite Dynamo Dresden’s squad being quarantined for two weeks. Dresden’s players were sent home after two tested positive for coronavirus. This means the second tier club cannot play their first two games of the restart – against Hannover on 17 May and against Fürth the following weekend. However, speaking to ZDF, the Bundesliga chief executive, Christian Seifert, said that what had happened in Dresden, where the local authorities told the club the players had to be quarantined, did not mean the top two divisions could not kick off on Saturday 16 May. “For the second division that means at the moment that from 81 games, two Dynamo Dresden games can’t be played.

That depends on how many teams are affected and how much time is left to finish the season. Seifert added there was enough leeway in the scheduling for Dresden to play all their remaining games.
