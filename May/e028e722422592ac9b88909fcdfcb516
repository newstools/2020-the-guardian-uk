Dervla Murphy’s intrepid bike rides, Bruce Chatwin’s original storytelling or Freya Stark’s Arabian adventures … this week we’d like to hear about your travel hero. They may not be a writer or celebrity – we often get top travel inspo from a tour guide or chance acquaintance whose attitude and adventures strike a chord. Use the form below to tell us about the wanderer who, especially in lockdown, quickens your pulse and raises your spirits – keeping your tip to about 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 12 May at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are very welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
