Use garam masala or curry powder if you don’t have individual spices. Prep 10 minCook 10 minServes 1 1 shallot or ½ onion2cm piece ginger1 garlic clove1 pinch coriander seed1 tsp salt 1 green chilliJuice of 1 lime1 large handful mint 2 handfuls coriander1 ½ tbsp vegetable oil1 tomato, chopped¼ tsp each chilli powder and ground cumin400g new potatoes (I used jersey royals), boiled and chopped1 tin chickpeas, drained2 tsp mango chutney For the dressing2 tbsp natural yoghurt½ fennel seed¼ tsp each ground cumin and ground cinnamon Put the shallot, ginger, garlic, coriander seeds, salt, green chilli, the lime juice and a large handful each of mint and coriander into a food processor, and blitz into a paste. Fry half the paste in the vegetable oil for a few seconds, then add the tomato, chilli and cumin powders and fry for a minute. Add the potatoes and chickpeas. Cook for two minutes, then mix in the mango chutney. Mix with another handful of fresh coriander and scatter over the rest of the green paste. Now make the dressing: blitz the natural yoghurt with ½ tsp salt, the fennel seeds, ground cumin and ground cinnamon, then pour this over the salad just before serving. This would work well with tinned mackerel in place of the sardines, and beetroot would be a good substitute for fennel. Prep 10 minRest 15 minServes 1 ¼ fennel bulbSalt2 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tsp caster sugar1 pinch fennel seeds½ kohlrabi½ shallot1 tin sardines (preferably in chilli oil)Olive oil (optional)Dried chilli flakes (optional) Finely slice the fennel and put it in a bowl with a pinch of salt and any of its fronds. In another bowl, whisk the vinegar with the caster sugar until the sugar has dissolved, then add the fennel seeds. Peel and shave strips from the kohlrabi into the vinegar, then finely slice the shallot and add that too. Toss to coat, set aside for 10-15 minutes, then combine with the fennel. When it’s time to eat, open the tin of sardines. If they’re packed in chilli oil, drizzle some of this over the salad. If not, dress with a little olive oil and some dried chilli flakes. Flake over the sardine and enjoy. You could use kohlrabi or finely sliced beetroot rather than celeriac. Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 1 50g puy lentils1 bay leaf¼ peeled celeriac½ fennel bulb½ leek1 apple1 celery stick1 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted1 tbsp capers1 tbsp shaved hard cheeseSalt and black pepper For the dressing50ml olive oilThe juice of ½ lemon3 tsp mustard2 tbsp mayonnaiseSalt and black pepper In well-salted water, boil the lentils with the bay leaf until tender. Finely slice the celeriac, fennel, leek, apple and celery, then mix these with the drained lentils. Add the pumpkin seeds, capers and cheese, then season to taste. In a small jar with a tight-fitting lid, shake up the dressing ingredients, taste and adjust the seasoning. Dress the salad when you’re ready to eat. Use finely sliced carrot or cucumber if you can’t find radishes, and tinned mackerel would be lovely instead of the tuna. Prep 10 minServes 1 6 radishes1 small fennel bulb2 spring onions1 bunch flat-leaf parsleyLemon juiceSalt and black pepper1 tin cannellini beans1 tin tuna in sunflower oil, drained For the dressing2 tbsp olive oilJuice of ½ lemon1 dash Tabasco Finely chop the radishes, fennel, spring onions and parsley, then season with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Drain and rinse the beans, and toss with the salad. Whisk the olive oil with the juice of half a lemon, a dash of Tabasco and some salt and pepper, and use this to dress the veg. Top with the tuna, and serve. * The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish. For ratings in your region, check: UK; Australia; US.
