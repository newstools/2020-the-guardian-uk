In lockdown in New York, Norah Jones and her husband, Pete, have started a new musical tradition: playing Christmas songs every Sunday. Their children – a six-year-old and a four-year-old whose names Jones has always kept anonymous – aren’t impressed. “We’re basically doing it to cheer up the grownups in the house. The kids also don’t like the fact they don’t get any presents! ” Jones is hiding in the bedroom while home schooling goes on elsewhere. She’s finding it “scary… and really hard to read the news” at the moment, she says. Still, she’s pleased to have something creative going on: her new album, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, comes out next month, and she’s been doing weekly livestream concerts on Facebook. She’s also enjoying playing tunes in the house in the mornings (“given that I’m now here every morning, for a change”) and her playlist of peaceful songs is one she’s changed 10 times, and rigorously home tested. “These are songs for that mood when you want a quiet breakfast, not that I have much of those at the moment! But they’re simple and beautiful. I can’t do walls of sound at the beginning of the day. I want songs that give me a peaceful energy.” Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam GuébrouThe Homeless WandererThis is from the fantastic Éthiopiques series. This woman’s solo piano playing blows my mind. Ali Farka Touré and Toumani DiabatéKalaThis has been my most-played record for the last 15 years. I do yoga to it too. My kids get confused if it’s playing and I’m not in a pose!

Joe Talbot’s been locked down in Cardiff with his father, but this period has coincided with a time he’d be largely isolated anyway: Idles are finishing mixing and mastering their new album, the much-anticipated follow-up to 2018’s Mercury-nominated Joy as an Act of Resistance. “We’re having Zoom meetings instead, as a band, which is pretty intense.” They’ve also started writing new songs remotely from each other (“we’ve never done that before”) and sharing music through playlists via video calls. “It’s like we’re all in a musical book club,” he laughs. Talbot felt strangely ready for lockdown, he says, after a difficult year in which he’s been undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy. “I’d been learning a lot about not focusing on the past, about embracing the moment, and living a life of presence despite whatever else was going on… and, hello, here we are.” Even though Talbot’s been listening to all kinds of music, songs that give him a spiritual, mindful lift have helped him most. “I was always the kid with headphones on in school, though,” he says. “Music is something where I’ve always sought refuge and solace.” Colin StetsonTo See More LightThe first ever instrumental music that made me think about how spirituality doesn’t have to be put into words.

Lauryn Hill I Find It Hard to Say (Rebel)This is a woman breaking down, picking herself up, finding strength. Rapper Flohio is on lockdown on her own in her block of flats in Bermondsey. “Man, it’s been eating away at me slowly,” she sighs. She’s reacted by throwing herself into everything: dyeing her hair red, writing a diary, baking (“I’ve gone in light so far, but I wanted to go deep!”) and spending hours listening to other people’s music. This makes a big change for her. “Before, I’d listen to my own tracks all the time thinking: ‘How do I make myself better?’ Now I’m sat down with my laptop actively searching through Instagram, YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify, flipping everything, trying to learn.” She’s also been throwing herself into high-energy music to work out, even though she’s naturally lazy, she laughs. “I’ve been running up and down the stairs of the block of flats for fun. I miss performing. That was my exercise! All that jumping up and down.” She’s been blasting out this playlist from her Alexa in her flat, moving to it even when she’s doing her laundry. “These tracks put your mind in a good state. They remind you one day we’re going to break out of these cages for good and fly.” Angel HazeSing About MeThis is for its intro, telling you how music opens a trapdoor, and locks you in.
