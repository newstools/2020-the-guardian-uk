What a relief it was to find last Saturday’s supplements in a paper envelope rather than in a potato starch wrapper. I live in a flat and we have no green bin. Determined to put my potato starch wrap in the right place, I took it to the local recycling centre, only to be told that it could not go in the garden waste container as the firm they use for garden waste cannot take potato starch. The paper envelope can be reused or go straight into our normal recycling box. Please use the paper envelope from now on.Jennifer LorchLeamington Spa, Warwickshire • As much as I appreciate the biodegradable packaging around the Saturday supplements, please could you replace it with an essential sick bag for use whenever the government claims to be “world-leading”.Ian TodEyemouth, Berwickshire • I stayed alert on Thursday and so I noticed that our Guardian had a wraparound advert from the government saying “Stay alert!” But it wasn’t the right one. The message in Wales is “Stay at home, save lives”. So, please, do stay alert and send me the right message next time.Mary WinterAberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
