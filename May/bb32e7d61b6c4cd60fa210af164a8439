Why does it take me at least twice as long to cook a dish as the time suggested in the printed recipe? And is there a better algorithm for determining the total time it will really take than my personal formula of 20 + 2P + 1½C minutes, where 20 is the time needed to track down all the ingredients (which is never shown) and P and C are the published preparation and cooking times respectively?
