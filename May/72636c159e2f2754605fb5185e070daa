Hundreds of workers have been flown in from Romania to pick fruit and vegetables after it was reported that thousands of British workers rejected job offers. Many British applicants got in touch with the Guardian to say farmers have made it difficult for them to secure the work. We would like to hear from seasonal workers who have travelled to the UK to work on farms or in any other sectors. Have you done seasonal work before? Tell us about what you did. What has your experience been like? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.
