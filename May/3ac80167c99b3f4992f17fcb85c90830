McDonald’s has announced it will reopen some of its UK restaurants in mid-May, and will take the temperature of every employee using contactless thermometers at start of each shift. The company will reopen 15 of its 1,270 restaurants on 13 May, initially only for delivery orders. They will be staffed by smaller teams than usual, and will offer a limited menu. The locations will be revealed next week. McDonald’s joins a group of fast food companies, including rivals Nando’s and Burger King, to start phased reopenings while the lockdown continues. The chain’s UK and Ireland chief executive, Paul Pomroy, said the company had trialled the new safety measures after almost two months’ closure, but added that service would not be same as before. “When we return it will be different as we all adjust to this new normal. I want to apologise in advance if our first wave of reopened restaurants does not serve your area,” Pomroy said. The company’s 120,000 UK employees will be asked to confirm they are fit and able to work before returning, and will have their temperature checked on arrival at work. They will be provided with protective equipment including non-medical-grade face masks. Every branch will be deep-cleaned before it reopens, with Perspex screens installed along with floor markings to indicate safe physical distancing. Staff and delivery workers will be asked to practise distancing. Restaurants and pubs were included in the government shutdown measures, but they are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery.
