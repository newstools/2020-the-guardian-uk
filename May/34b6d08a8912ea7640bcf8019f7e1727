Transparency is one of HC-One’s founding values. We have therefore published online the full the letter we sent to the councils we work with regarding our request for financial support (Coronavirus fears leading families to remove relatives from UK care homes, 4 May). This letter clearly sets out how coronavirus has affected our organisation, its financial implications, and the action we have taken in response. It seeks to start a conversation with our council partners about access to the funding the government has already provided to support frontline care providers to cover the rising costs of responding to coronavirus. The Local Government Association estimates provider costs have increased by at least 10%. The government’s Covid-19 Social Care Action Plan states that councils must “protect providers’ cashflow”. Our suggestion to councils of a short-term income guarantee is both consistent with these statements and reflects the offers of support we’ve already received from some councils. We hope for further constructive conversations with our council partners as we must work together to respond to this unprecedented public health emergency.David SmithFinance director, HC-One Ltd
