For those of us working from home, or juggling childcare with a job, the pandemic has arguably redefined the way we dress. Not least because it was spring when we went into lockdown and now itâ€™s summer. If you are working from home, trying to stay cool without buying a new pair of shorts, or simply wanting to refresh your wardrobe for video conferences, we want to hear from you. With a focus on re-styling your pre-existing wardrobe rather than buying anything new, send us your questions. Are you struggling to avoid wearing jogging bottoms day in, day out? Maybe you want to know how to style a Breton striped T-shirt in a work-friendly, babyproof way? Or, if you are going to shop, you might like to find the best place to buy a white T-shirt you will wear for ever, the most sustainable and socially conscious brands to support, or the best place to find affordable earrings for Zoom calls. Email your questions to fashion.desk@guardian.co.uk and then tune into an Instagram live conversation on Tuesday 26 May @guardianfashion at 1pm to hear them answered.
