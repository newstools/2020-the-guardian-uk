Welcome back to our Spooks series one watch along - I’m sitting in again for Sarah Hughes, who we hope will be back running the department next week for the series one finale. Tonight! Season one, episode five, originally shown on BBC One on 10 June 2002, but shown by all of us on our own devices today at 7pm, London time, when we hit play on iPlayer simultaneously and chat about the episode in the comments box below. Get ready for a tale of secrets, corruption, disgraced politicians, and a possible Russian sleeper. Plus: a little extra bit of Hugh Laurie, as a treat. No spoilers if you can remember what happens, although most of our regular band of re-watchers are finding that we’ve forgotten everything and it’s like watching a new show. Join us! • Get ready to hit play at 7pm BST (on BBC iPlayer in the UK, and Britbox in the US, where the show is called MI-5)
