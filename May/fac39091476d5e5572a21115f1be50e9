The Metropolitan police made the arrests after three men suffered stab wounds in Hyde Park near Knightsbridge. The victims are in a stable condition, the force said. Officers arrived at the scene at 7.28pm along with the London ambulance service after they were notified of a disorder near the Serpentine lake. The four men arrested are being held in police custody. Officers have appealed for witnesses or anyone with video footage to call them on 101 quoting CAD 8150. A section 60 order, which gives police the power to stop and search anyone in the area, is in place for the borough of Westminster until 6am on Sunday.
