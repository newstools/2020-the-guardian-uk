This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Birmingham Museums Trust – Fine Art Collection. Birmingham Museums has around 35,000 items of mainly western European art, including paintings, works on paper, sculpture, digital art and photography from the 12th to the 21st centuries. It is well known for its substantial and internationally significant collection of the pre-Raphaelites and their contemporaries. You can see art from Birmingham Museums on Art UK here.
