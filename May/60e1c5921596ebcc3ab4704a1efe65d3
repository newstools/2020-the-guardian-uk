This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Foundling Museum, which tells the remarkable story of the Foundling Hospital, the UK’s first children’s charity and first public art gallery. By transforming disadvantaged children’s lives through the arts, the museum continues the work of the hospital’s governors, Hogarth and Handel, and through its collections, exhibitions, commissions and participatory projects, it inspires people to make the world a better place. You can see art from the Foundling Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the Foundling Museum website here.
