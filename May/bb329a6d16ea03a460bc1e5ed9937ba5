This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the McManus: Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum. The McManus is a multi-disciplinary museum with wide-ranging collections of art, social and natural history, archaeology, and world cultures. Its fine art, applied art and whaling industry collections are recognised as being of national significance by Museums Galleries Scotland. In March 2020, The McManus was named Scottish visitor attraction of the year.You can see art from the McManus on Art UK here. Find out more on the McManus website here.
