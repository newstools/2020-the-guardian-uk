When social distancing and lockdown measures began in the UK, packets of eggs, yeast and flour disappeared from supermarket shelves as people turned to home baking to pass the time. Others have taken up gaming, gardening, or virtual dance classes. For some people in lockdown, the sanctioned daily exercise has been a chance to discover jogging and outdoor fitness. We’d like to hear about the new skills or hobbies you’ve discovered while in lockdown. Have you learned to make bread or begun to bake? Are you learning a language, or perfecting a headstand? Or have you rediscovered a hobby from your past? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.
