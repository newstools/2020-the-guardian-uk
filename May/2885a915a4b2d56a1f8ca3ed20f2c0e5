This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums. The gallery is home to one of the finest collections in the UK, with works by historic and contemporary Scottish artists, designers and makers such as Henry Raeburn, Joan Eardley, Samuel Peploe, Rachel Maclean and Bill Gibb, as well as internationally acclaimed artists including Barbara Hepworth, Francis Bacon, Tracey Emin and Claude Monet. It reopened in 2019 following a landmark redevelopment. You can see art from Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums on Art UK here. Find out more on the Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums website here.
