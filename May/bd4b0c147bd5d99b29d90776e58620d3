I don’t agree that the “clap for carers” has become politicised (Let’s stop clapping for the NHS, says woman who started the ritual, 22 May). It might have become an empty gesture for some, a tedious ritual for others, but for this elderly person staying safe in lockdown, it is a special moment that lights up each week. I look forward to seeing my neighbours, having some brief conversations and just feeling grateful we are all still there for each other – reasons enough to clap our hands in these uncertain times.Susan TreagusManchester • Re the ancient description of the Church of England as “the Tory party at prayer” (Letters, 25 May), a more recent description of the clergy as “Guardian readers preaching to Mail readers” would be more accurate.Ian WellsWest Lancashire • The PM has announced a date for reopening non-essential shops.
