Quentin Tarantino has named David Fincher’s drama about the creation of Facebook, The Social Network, as the best film of the past decade. Speaking to Premiere, the director said the film, which stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, was “hands down” his top choice. “It is No 1 because it’s the best, that’s all! It crushes all the competition,” said Tarantino. Fincher’s film, released in 2010, was nominated for eight Oscars and won three, losing out on best picture to The King’s Speech. Tarantino, 57, singled out Aaron Sorkin’s script for particular praise, calling him “the greatest active dialogist”. The director is a noted fan of Sorkin’s, having previously said he’d watch each new episode of HBO drama The Newsroom three times in a week. He is also an aficionado of Fincher, naming Fight Club on a comparable list of the best films made between 1992 and 2009. Tarantino had already named Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan’s 2017 war drama, his second best film of the decade. His top pick from the films of 2019 was Crawl, a little seen horror film about ravenous alligators. The Social Network was named the 54th best film of the decade by the Guardian.
