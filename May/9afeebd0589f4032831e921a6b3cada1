The Netherlands manager, Ronald Koeman, has undergone a heart procedure in Amsterdam after experiencing chest pain and is due to return home on Monday. The 57-year-old, who had spells in the Premier League with Everton and Southampton, was taken to hospital in Amsterdam after falling ill at his home. Koeman underwent cardiac catheterisation, which involves the placement of a long, thin tube into a vein or artery and is typically performed without general anaesthetic, and will return home on Monday. He was taken from his home by ambulance but after surgical intervention was in a stable condition, his wife, Bartina, told the newspaper De Telegraaf. A statement from the Dutch football association, the KNVB, read: “Ronald Koeman was hospitalised on Sunday evening after chest complaints. The 57-year-old national team coach of the Dutch national team has undergone a successful cardiac catheterisation and will return home tomorrow. We wish Ronald a lot of strength and improvement.” The Liverpool and Netherlands midfielder, Georginio Wijnaldum, tweeted: “Wishing you soon recovery coach.” Wishing you soon recovery coach 🙏🏾 pic.twitter.com/N83qeOO2lC Koeman has been the Dutch coach for just over two years and helped the country to qualify for Euro 2020, which has been postponed to next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
