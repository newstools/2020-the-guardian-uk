The easing of some lockdown rules is a particularly tricky matter for the golfers of Llanymynech, on the border of England and Wales. Boris Johnson’s exit plan means golfers in England have begun to dig out their gear in readiness for tee-off time on Wednesday, but clubs in Wales are expected to remain closed. The problem for Llanymynech, a hilly course located between Welshpool and Shrewsbury, is that some of it lies in England and some in Wales. Fifteen holes are wholly in Wales and two in England. On the fourth hole, the golfer hits his or her first shot in Wales and putts out on a green in England. The course has been closed since the start of lockdown but members are beginning to wonder if there is any way they can argue that it ought to reopen. The club secretary, Sian Whiteoak, said: “We’re trying to work it out. We have some holes in England and some holes in Wales, so we don’t know what we can do.” The club is governed by English Golf, which is expecting the sport to restart – with conditions – in England on Wednesday. A statement on the Wales Golf (Golff Cymru) website said: “There is no change to the current position in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and so golf courses in these countries will remain closed for now.”
