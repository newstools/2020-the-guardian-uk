Kyle Walker believes he is being harassed by the media after contravening lockdown rules again when visiting his parents and sister, with Manchester City deciding against disciplinary action due to extenuating circumstances. The Sun reported that Walker travelled to Sheffield on Wednesday to visit his sister and parents. This came after the defender apologised following a report he held a party at his house with two sex workers present last month, breaking lockdown rules. While City will discipline Walker for the latter episode, it is understood that the 29-year-old’s personal circumstances means the club will not act over Wednesday’s transgression. In a statement posted on Twitter on Thursday Walker hinted at this. “It is sad, but I feel as though my life is being scrutinised without any context,” he said. “I understand if people are upset or angry with me, but it was important for people to have a better understanding of my life,” he said. “I have recently gone through one of the toughest periods of my life, which I take full responsibility for. However, I now feel as though I am being harassed. This is no longer solely affecting me but affecting the health of my family and my young children too. “At a time when the focus is understandably on Covid-19, at what point does mental health get taken into consideration? I am a human being, with feelings of pain and upset like everybody else. Being in the public eye does not make you immune to this.” Walker criticised the media for invading his privacy. “In relation to the events on Wednesday, I travelled to Sheffield to give my sister a birthday card and present, but also to speak to one of the few people I believe I can trust in my life,” he said. “She hugged me to remind me that she cares and that I am loved. What am I meant to do – push her away? “I then travelled to my parents’ house to pick up some home-cooked meals. It’s been an extremely tough couple of months for them.”
