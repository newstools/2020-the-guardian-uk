Thousands of people around the world are jogging to celebrate the birthday of man they never knew – Ahmaud Arbery. It is part of a global campaign to pay homage to 25-year-old Arbery, nicknamed Maud, who was shot and killed by two white men while out jogging in Georgia. Ahmaud was born on 8 May 1994 and would have turned 26 on Friday. The idea for a global run in Arbery’s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running. Now, the hashtag #IRunWithMaud has travelled the world, with runners from London to New York completing the 2.23-mile trip – a tribute to the date of his death, which occurred on 23 February. The hashtag now has more than 60,000 posts on Instagram. Hand on my heart ❤️ 🙏🏾 this morning. #irunwithmaud 👑 pic.twitter.com/YtjhggoaxD The worldwide run follows news this morning that Arbery’s killers will face murder charges over the attack. Gregory and Travis McMichael told officers they thought Arbery resembled a suspect in a series of nearby break-ins. The pair were charged with murder and aggravated assault. Police were aware of the crime for more than two months but did not charge the McMichaels until after the shooting gained widespread attention. When video footage of Arbery’s killing circulated online, celebrities such as LeBron James and Naomi Campbell called for justice, as well as politicians Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. #irunwithmaud We ran for Ahmaud Arbery and his family today. I pray our country will overcome hatred and violence and ignorance. pic.twitter.com/wi6xW7VL5N “Exercising while black should not be a death sentence,” said Harris in a tweet on Tuesday. .#ahmaudarbery Sending blessing to his family and loved ones. We must continue to keep his name uplifted until he gets justice in the courts. We must use this tragedy to spring us into action. We want #justiceforahmaud and until then #irunwithmaud ✊🏾https://t.co/tqk5nP2yil pic.twitter.com/gIPeCqbn8U A life needlessly taken. I'm praying for the family and may good come out of this. #IrunwithMaud pic.twitter.com/bY9Sl8ahDn I walked a very emotional and tearful 2.23 miles this morning . For those that know me know I hate all things cardio and I got bad knees lol but I did it for Ahmaud. I didn’t know the young king the was murdered in cold blood but it resonated with me heavy. Maybe because I think of how that could have been my brother or cousin .Maybe it’s the ample amount of times I have felt uncomfortable in my life for being one of the few black families in my community and the stares that accompanied that when we moved in. Or the times where I’ve been followed in the store because I looked “threatening” and could possibly steal. or maybe the time where I was pulled over for a headlight being out and was told to get out of my car with my hands where the officer could see them. Or maybe that one time I was traveling with my family and a restaurant blatantly refused to serve us, I wish I could make this up y’all • I’ve been traumatized before by my own fathers tragic death. This was triggering. I’m not sure how to not stop thinking about this young man. But maybe I’m not supposed to. As a someone training to be a physician I feel it is my obligation to advocate for those without a voice. And with this platform I plan on doing that. There is power in numbers. Ahmaud Arbery this is for you. I’m praying this brings people to realize racism has never gone away. We don’t talk about these issues to “bring up the past” . It is very much our present day. Microaggressions and bigotry are thriving in this country. It is not invisible. #justiceforahmaud #irunwithmaud A post shared by  Michelle Chinwe, MS 🇳🇬✨ (@dolcemimi_) on May 8, 2020 at 7:47am PDT Each morning I run or bike to stay in shape BUT today #IRunWithMaud and for #JusticeForAhmaud! #EnoughSaid pic.twitter.com/edNsxeF9c0 Wanted to come up with some thoughtful words in the midst of all this but I'm just tired. ⠀ ⠀ Tired of the constant reminders that we're not welcome in this country that was built on the backs of our ancestors. ⠀ ⠀ Tired of the silence of those that claim to be our allies.⠀ ⠀ Tired of charges that don't result in convictions. ⠀ ⠀ Tired of hashtags.⠀ ⠀ Today I ran 2.23 miles in memory of Ahmaud Arbery and in honor his sister/my Soror, and their family. Although most of us are just now hearing of this tragedy, this is a nightmare that they have been living since February 23rd.⠀ ⠀ I truly hope that the recent arrest of his murderers will result in justice through a conviction; however, history shows me that it’s not likely. ⠀ ⠀ Until this becomes an issue for all and not just those that look like me, we’ll continue to sing the same song.⠀ ⠀ I’m exhausted.⠀ ⠀ #irunwithmaud #blacklivesmatter #ahmaudarbery A post shared by  Ashley (@clarkeayye) on May 8, 2020 at 9:44am PDT
