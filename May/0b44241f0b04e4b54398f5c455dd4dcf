I test sex toys for a living, so I thought I knew a lot about the female orgasm. Then I discovered “sexual transmutation” – the idea that you can harness your sexual energy to achieve goals. The practice is nothing new – it exists in Tantric and Taoist traditions. But I set about developing my own “masturbation for manifestation” method. My system combines the law of attraction (the belief that we attract into our lives whatever we focus on) with visualisation techniques and my own orgasmic energy. I set an intention, then stimulate myself sexually while I use my imagination to eroticise my aim. For instance, to manifest a new home, I might imagine myself inside it: my bare feet against the floor, naked on the new sofa and something erotic happening there. When I reach orgasm, the energy is released into the universe, where it begins to attract the ideal place. Some desires are easier to eroticise than others. Getting aroused while I thought about loan repayments was a challenge, but last summer I managed to become debt-free. I find masturbation with intention also takes a lot longer than when I was focused just on pleasure. This is a practice I reserve only for masturbation: when I’m having sex with someone, I’m focused on sharing an intimate moment. Thanks to my technique, I have manifested some incredible things, such as professional opportunities, holidays, even love. I hardly recognise my life now. It doesn’t always work, but at least I enjoy the process. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
