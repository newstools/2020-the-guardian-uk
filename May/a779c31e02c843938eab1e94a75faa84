I am from Austria and have lived in this country for over 50 years, and have enjoyed reading the Guardian ever since. The quick crossword is the highlight of the morning. I disagree with some answers, but after a bit of deliberation I accept them. But I must object to the spelling of 5 down on Monday. Hapsburg instead of Habsburg! The name comes from Habichtsburg, hawk’s castle. No P in sight.Barbara RogersCambridge • Given the government’s total incompetence, it might save you time just to keep the headline “Ministers under fire amid chaos over…” and add the latest disaster each day (Coronavirus: UK contact-tracing applicants wrongly told hiring paused in latest ‘misstep’, 18 May).Judy TurnerMalvern, Worcestershire • Re your report on pubs (Locked down pubs forced to pour 70m pints of beer down the drain, 15 May), it is tragic that publicans are pouring away unsold beer. If HMRC would allow relief on beer duty, it could be fermented to produce a lifetime of malt vinegar. A welcome legacy for meals we look forward to enjoying when pub doors open again.Keith ThomasRichmond, North Yorkshire • I’m not sure if you can strain marmalade through tights (Letters, 14 May). However, they are perfect for holding the pips in the pan to release their pectin while cooking.Zoe GleisnerBeckley, East Sussex • A whole issue of Feast without chillies (16 May)? So it is possible! And may we have a savoury one soon please?Rosemary ChamberlinBristol• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
