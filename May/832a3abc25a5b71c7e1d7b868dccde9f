The Manchester City and Scotland winger Caroline Weir has become the 150th person to sign up to the Common Goal movement. Common Goal, founded by Manchester United’s Juan Mata and Street Football World in 2017, asks those involved in football to commit 1% of their incomes to sporting charities. Jürgen Klopp, Eric Cantona, Megan Rapinoe and the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, are among those who have joined, with the Danish side Nordsjælland the first professional club to support the campaign, which has raised more than €2m (£1.75m) for organisations using football for good in more than 40 countries. Mata paid tribute to the legacy being built by the group. “At this time of crisis, the need for teamwork is clear,” he said. “Collaboration is the best shot we have of ending Covid-19 and tackling the other challenges we face. It gives great hope to see so many diverse players stepping forward to work together on providing immediate solutions.” Weir’s contribution will be channelled through the new Common Goal Covid-19 Response Fund which will invest into its community organisations hardest hit by the pandemic. Weir, who has 71 caps, is the third Manchester City Women player to join Common Goal, following the Germany forward Pauline Bremer, who leaves City for Wolfsburg at the end of the season, and the Canadian forward Janine Beckie. Weir said: “I’m delighted to be joining the Common Goal team; it’s a fantastic initiative. It helps to raise funds and awareness for causes I am passionate about, such as gender equality and female empowerment, as well as providing necessary relief for those in need during the pandemic. “Teamwork is a fundamental part of football, and Common Goal epitomises the importance of working as a team to achieve a shared ambition.”
