A British diplomat who hosted the Duke of Sussex during a tour of Nepal has gone missing after going for a run from his UK home. Richard Morris, 52, has not been seen since he went jogging in his home village of Bentley near Farnham, Hampshire, last Wednesday morning. A Hampshire police spokesman said: “His family are understandably concerned for his welfare.” Morris was the ambassador to Nepal between 2015 and November 2019 and accompanied Harry during his tour of the country in 2016. Prior to that he was head of the Pacific department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and he has held senior diplomatic posts including in Australia and Mexico. The police spokesman said: “Richard is described as being white, around 6ft tall, with greying hair and a beard. He is also described as having a port birthmark on his face. He was last seen wearing a blue long-sleeved top with a half zip, black shorts and blue trainers. “We are now asking residents in the surrounding areas if they could assist by checking sheds, outbuildings and gardens. We would also love to hear from any residents or businesses with CCTV that could help our enquiries.” He added: “We would like to reassure people that we have professional search teams conducting a thorough search of local areas, and would respectfully ask members of the public not to attempt to look for Richard, outside of your own property, themselves. “This is so teams can accurately monitor all areas that have been police-searched to a professional standard and so potential tracking can be conducted by search dogs.”
