A Caribbean beach shack with standout rum punch, sake and exotic snacks at a tiny izakaya in Tokyo, or a Moscow dive where you drank too much vodka with the locals. Maybe you found the wackiest coffee bar in still-weird Portland … Ducking into a bar for something cold or caffeinated is a holiday ritual, and this week we’d like to hear about the most memorable drinking hole you’ve found on travels abroad – no cosy British pubs this time, much as we’re looking forward to a well-kept pint… Please use the form below to tell us about your favourite bar, including location and website if appropriate, keeping your tip to around 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 2 June at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you to share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide, please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here
