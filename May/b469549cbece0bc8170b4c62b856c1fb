What is “X Æ A-12”, and why is it trending on Twitter? That, my friend, is the name of tech billionaire Elon Musk and musician Grimes’ first child together. At least according to Elon Musk, who tweeted “X Æ A-12 Musk” when one of his 33.7 million followers demanded to know his newborn baby’s name. X Æ A-12 Musk Is this … real? Or is he trolling? Probably both, in a sense. Most people are working under the assumption that Musk’s tweet is a code for the baby’s real name. The fact Grimes’ has a track on her latest album, Miss Anthropocene, named ‘4 Æ M’; as in “for Æ Musk”, lends weight to the theory. Then Grimes stepped in to clear things up with a brand new cypher that explained Æ stands for AI and X stands for ‘X’. •X, the unknown variable ⚔️•Æ, my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence)•A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft). No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent 🤍+ (A=Archangel, my favorite song) (⚔️🐁 metal rat) Glad we’re all on the same page then. But seriously, what does it say on the birth certificate? There are several working theories on how to pronounce ‘X Æ A-12 Musk’ and what it might mean at the moment. Grimes' child: my name's X Æ A-12me: how do u pronounce that?Grimes' child: pic.twitter.com/cyPDDKh28V for those of u asking how X Æ A-12 is pronounced, it’s pic.twitter.com/o8u4RQINH9 Omg I figured out how to pronounce X Æ A-12 pic.twitter.com/ppfE0x8Nfh What we do know is that the Lockheed A-12 fighter jet’s original code name was ‘Archangel’ – which is pretty on brand for both Musk (who likes aircrafts so much he’s building a space program) and Grimes (who uses plenty of biblical references in her work). As for the ‘X’; one follower guessed ‘Xavier’ which is unlikely, given Musk already has a son named Xavier; Neal, Alexander and Sasha are also popular guesses. As is straight up ‘X’. There was speculation that Æ referred to the ligature Ash. But now Grimes has stepped in to clear things up, it’s possible the baby is really named Xai Archangel Musk. Or, you know X Æ A-12 Musk. As for the “metal rat” bit – a Chinese Zodiac calendar makes that line a little less weird than it originally sounds. Why are people so fascinated with this couple?The pair both had pretty obsessive fan communities going into the relationship – many of whom (mostly Grimes fans) had mixed feelings about them as a couple. Since then there’s been a constant stream of drama about them, including a run in with ubiquitous beefer Azealia Banks, a lot of complaints about their mismatched politics (she’s been a Bernie supporter since 2016; he thinks we should “FREE AMERICA NOW”) and, of course, the baby build up. Grimes announced she was pregnant on Instagram by posting a photoshopped image of herself with a translucent, Space Odyssey-esque fetus inside her, and at the time no one was sure if it was a record teaser or an actual declaration that she was with child. Censored for insta haha - almost got away w it 😮 A post shared by  ꧁ ༒ Gℜiꪔ⃕es ༒꧂ (@grimes) on Jan 8, 2020 at 3:42pm PST Later she confirmed the news with a more confessional, conventional post, so I’d say that, much like a new Tesla model release or a album drop this is a phased marketing campaign for the miracle of life. But then again, he once got into a Twitter feud with a hero navy diver, so heated it ended up in court; and her entire pop persona is built around weirdness, so who knows what it really says on the birth certificate. Where does this sit on the mad celebrity baby name spectrum?If it’s not a code and the kid really is named X Æ A-12, I’m going to go ahead and award the name five out of five Moon Units. It’s definitely weirder than Blue Ivy (who also has her name worked into plenty of her mum’s creative output); Apple and Moses; Shiloh and Pax, or even Nicholas Cage’s kid Kal-El. But, more likely, it’s a code for Xai Archangel – something a bit more normal sounding than, say, Kulture Kiari Cephus or Raddix Madden. Perhaps in an alternate timeline they would have gone with Pilot Inspektor, but sadly, it’s already taken. Whatever next? How does the next famous baby go further? Are we looking at the child of Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid being called a series of emojis?Honestly, I think weird celebrity baby names are becoming passe. With all the Daeneryses; Marvels and Teslas running around (seriously, 141 babies were named for Musk’s automotive brand in 2017) – calling your kid Kyd, just doesn’t seem that provocative anymore.
