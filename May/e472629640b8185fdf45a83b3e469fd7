In a parallel world, the FA Cup final was contested at Wembley on Saturday and attention is now turning to the Champions League final in Istanbul this coming weekend. The domestic leagues have been settled; the Football League play-offs have come and gone; and, instead of planning weekends around Premier League games and weeknights around European fixtures, sports fans are turning their attention to Wimbledon, the Open, Euro 2020 and the Olympics. But that will all have to wait. Sport is making a gentle, spluttering comeback – with managers in masks, substitutes sitting six feet apart and players reluctant to celebrate with their teammates – but sport as we knew it will not be back for some time. What do you miss most about the old normal? Gathering in the pub for a big Champions League night? That quickening walk to the ground as you hear the team being read over the Tannoy? Sitting down to watch Match of the Day with your family? Being part of an ongoing soap opera that punctuates your weekends, connects you to your friends and gives you something to talk about with people you have never met before? Or, perhaps you are not missing sport half as much as you expected. Maybe having some time away has served as a tonic and made you realise that sport isn’t as important as you thought – that it’s not a matter of life and death after all. If you have either missed sport or found it strangely unimportant over the last few months, we want to hear from you. You can get in touch by filling in the form below.
