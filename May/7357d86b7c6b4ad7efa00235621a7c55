Let’s not forget Radio 4 (BBC Radio 3 is an oasis of calm in troubling times, Letters, 5 May), and the thoughtful, informative and entertaining conversation that virtual guests during lockdown offer in programmes like In Our Time and More or Less. A daily stimulus to think beyond immediate concerns.Malcolm NewtonAbingdon, Oxfordshire • One of the delights of buying the Guardian is reading obituaries of remarkable people such as immunologist William Frankland (Obituary, 20 April), who was four weeks old when the Titanic sank, survived a Japanese PoW camp, persuaded Saddam Hussein to stop smoking and was still working at the age of 105. Learning about such fascinating lives in these troubling times is uplifting and humbling.Toby WoodPeterborough • Equuleus, the only word containing a double U, according to John D Walsh (Letters, 6 May). My copy of Chambers includes Weltanschauung – there may be others.Paul JenkinsonZollikon, Switzerland • Reading John D Walsh’s letter, I guess he doesn’t own a vacuum cleaner.Chris HentonCardiff • I’m in lockdown with my adult son and two-year-old grandson in a flat without garden or balcony. We do the usual stuff with a toddler: waterplay in the shower, trampolining on beds, but, if I’d been in charge, I’d have requisitioned gardens unused by their absent private owners and allocated timed golden tickets for children to play and enjoy some vitamin D.Lindsay BainbridgeTring, Hertfordshire
