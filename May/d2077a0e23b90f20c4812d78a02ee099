Israel’s defence minister has apologise for the police’s fatal shooting of an unarmed Palestinian man who had autism. The shooting of Iyad Halak, 32, in Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday, drew broad condemnation and revived complaints alleging excessive force by Israeli security forces. Benny Gantz, who is also Israel’s alternate prime minister under a power-sharing deal, made the remarks at the weekly meeting of the Israeli cabinet on Sunday. He was sitting near the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who made no mention of the incident in his opening remarks. “We are really sorry about the incident in which Iyad Halak was shot to death and we share in the family’s grief,” Gantz said. “I am sure this subject will be investigated swiftly and conclusions will be reached.” Halak’s relatives said he had autism and was heading to a school for students with special needs, where he studied each day, when he was shot. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect with an object that looked like a pistol. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. The police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, later said no weapon was found. Israeli media reported that the officers involved were questioned after the incident. It said a lawyer representing one of the officers sent his condolences to the family in an interview with Israeli army radio. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. Some pro-Palestinian activists compared Saturday’s shooting to recent cases of police violence in the US.
