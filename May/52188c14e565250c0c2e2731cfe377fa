Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Like many other people I’ve got a new interest in gardening, but I don’t know where to get seeds and other supplies. Can anyone recommend any good websites for plants, compost and the other things I’ll need to get growing? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
