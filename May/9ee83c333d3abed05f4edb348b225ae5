1) Gianfranco Zola at Chelsea. Zola at Napoli. And more of Zola in Serie A. Gianfranco Zola making life difficult. ðŸ‘Œ Our #OldSkoolSkillSkool feature on Chelsea TV is not to be missed... https://t.co/LSJmrcH0j2 pic.twitter.com/YbUgB1olE4 2) Itâ€™s 25 years since promoted Nottingham Forest stormed to a third-place Premier League finish in the 1994-95 season. Stan Collymoreâ€™s goals were crucial in Forest winning promotion the previous season, too, as this top 10 Colly-pilation across 1993-95 illustrates. His first goal for Liverpool was a touch special too. Hereâ€™s a more in-depth look at that comparatively disappointing spell. 3) Itâ€™s 30 years since Englandâ€™s memorable 1989-90 tour of West Indies. The era of West Indian dominance of the Test arena was drawing to a close but openers Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes raged against the dying of the light â€“ particularly in this first-innings opening stand of 298 in the fifth Test. Viv Richardsâ€™ men went on to take the match, sealing a 2-1 series win. Here are Ian Bishop and Courtney Walsh giving brave Robin Smith a fearful working-over in the same game. 4) This being 2020, it is a mere 10 years since Englandâ€™s best-forgotten 2010 World Cup campaign under Fabio Capello in South Africa. Letâ€™s cast our minds back to that summer, as John Terry tells Capello to pick Joe Cole in a press conference, followed by Eamon Dunphy and Graeme Souness falling out over it all on RTÃ‰. While weâ€™re on the subject of that infamous pundit panel, letâ€™s have a splash of Johnny Giles v Souness v Dunphy rowing about Arsenalâ€™s spending power or lack thereof. 5) In a parallel dimension, the all-important second legs of the Champions League semis were played this week. Weâ€™ve seen Spursâ€™ comeback in Amsterdam last year from every possible angle, so hereâ€™s the immediate aftermath, a tableaux of despair and joy. ðŸ¤¯ "I've never seen anything like this! Oh my God!" ðŸ¤¯It wasn't a dream. Tottenham's extraordinary fightback - the latest in an unforgettable Champions League campaign!Relive Spurs' jawdropping night in Amsterdam with #NoFilterUCL. pic.twitter.com/la27iJLJfz On to some forgotten greats: Jari Litmanen conducts the orchestra as Ajax tear Bayern Munich a new one in 1995, Giovane Elber plays a bit of keepy-uppy before putting Madrid to the sword, Gaizka Medieta with a first touch and finish to die for against Barcelona (the same season he did this against them), Oliver Neuville picks out Fabien Barthezâ€™s top corner to take Bayer Leverkusen into the 2002 final, and KakÃ¡ lights up Old Trafford five years later. (And not-so-forgotten greats: Ronald Koeman decides heâ€™d like a goal against Porto in 1994, Cristiano Ronaldo bursts the Emirates net in 2009,and Roy Maurice Keaneâ€™s finest hour.) Letâ€™s finish this section with a couple of Chelsea-Barcelona classics: the frenzied 2009 meeting and Chelseaâ€™s 2012 revenge mission. 6) The 2020 Giro dâ€™Italia would have started on Saturday so hereâ€™s some classic action: Italian icon Marco Pantani attacking Pavel Tonkov and Alex ZÃ¼lle in 1998. Alberto â€˜El Pistoleroâ€™ Contador firing shots at the 2015 edition. And Chris Froome blowing the race open â€“ and winning it â€“ on stage 19 in 2018. As a final bonus clip, from the Giro del Trentino (now the Tour of the Alps), hereâ€™s Bradley Wiggins trying to throw a bike away in disgust, only to see it park itself neatly against the wall. 1) The prime of Monica Seles, from 1993. 2) A Mike Tyson knockouts showreel. 3) Keeping their cool: the best golf play-off wins. 4) A tribute to Peter Ebdon, who announced his retirement last week. At his most methodical here, taking five minutes to rack up 12 points, and hereâ€™s his classic 2002 world final win over Stephen Hendry. And Ebdon the crooner. Last, but by no means least, in split-screen format, here is Ronnie Oâ€™Sullivan knocking in a maximum 147 in the time it took Ebdon to amass that 12 break â€¦ 5) The hand of Messi: a legend gets away with it. 6) Paul Erengâ€™s stunning 800m triumph at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
