Althea McNish was one of those very talented people always generous in their support of others. She and her husband John Weiss were members of the National Association for Design Education (NADE) in the 1980s, when I was chairman. NADE members were mainly classroom teachers, concerned with opening up the school curriculum to the full range of art, design, technology and environmental aspects of children’s learning. Althea’s enthusiasm was infectious, and her insights into aspects of design came from her own wide-ranging creativity. She and John once hosted a NADE committee meeting, sitting in the sun in their garden which was rich with Caribbean plants. At the end of the meeting she served a lunch of Caribbean delicacies.
