Some Christmas traditions – singing carols, for example, or eating a big roast dinner and falling asleep in front on the TV – are commonplace over the festive period. But many of us have developed our own customs which, although perhaps not deemed ‘traditional’, are now as much a part of our Christmas experiences as tinsel, trees and crackers. If you have an unconventional Christmas tradition, then we’d love to hear about it. Perhaps you always spend Christmas with people you don’t see at any other time of the year? Or maybe you always watch a specific film – but it’s not particularly festive? Tell us what you do to celebrate Christmas, and how your unusual tradition began.
