Christmas at home feels so familiar that – for most us – on the rare occasions we spend one abroad, it can be unforgettable, enchanting, or even discombobulating. Have you ever taken part in unusual local festivities or eaten a fantastic Christmas dinner in a far-off land? Perhaps you spent Christmas Day on a remote tropical beach, were invited to spend it with the locals or went to a church service conducted in a foreign language. Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.
