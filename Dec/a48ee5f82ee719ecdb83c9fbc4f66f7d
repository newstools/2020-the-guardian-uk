Adrian Lewis suffered a shock early exit from the PDC world championship at the hands of the American Danny Baggish in the second round at Alexandra Palace. Lewis, who won consecutive world titles in 2011 and 2012, paid for a slow start, missing 15 darts at doubles during the opening two sets. Although Lewis started to find his range in the third set with finishes of 84 and 127, Baggish landed a 170 checkout before completing a 3-1 victory. He will next take on the 2020 Premier League winner Glen Durrant. “I’m so happy. That is a special win for me,” said Baggish, who dedicated the impressive performance to his brother, Harrison, who suffered a severe stroke at home in Florida. “That was for my brother. I’m really emotional and that’s why I let it all out at the end. It has been a difficult and emotional 24 hours but I am doing him proud at that means everything.” Baggish, who knocked out the Australian Damon Heta in the first round, added: “People have written me off before both games but I will keep showing them.” Simon Whitlock, the 2010 runner-up, beat Lithuania’s Darius Labanauskas in five sets. The Australian landed 10 maximums and an average of 101.21 in his 3-2 victory. “Darius is a fantastic player. I knew I had to play my best darts to beat him and I was able to play some fantastic darts to get the job done,” Whitlock said. Joe Cullen defeated Wayne Jones 3-0 and will next face the Welsh World Cup of Darts winner Jonny Clayton. Brendan Dolan recorded a 3-1 win over the Japanese qualifier Edward Foulkes to secure his place in the third round against the world No 3 Gerwyn Price.
