For our third list of the best 100 female footballers in the world we have assembled a voting panel of 88 judges from 42 countries, led by the new US women’s national head coach Vlatko Andonovski and legends such as Lotta Schelin, Rhian Wilkinson and Anja Mittag. They are backed up by a selection of coaches, journalists and broadcasters, such as Arsenal’s WSL-winning manager, Joe Montemurro, and the Juventus manager, Rita Guarino. The former internationals have thousands of international caps between them while the managers have won titles in England, USA and even a World Cup. The countdown begins on Tuesday 8 December with Nos 100-71. On Wednesday we will reveal Nos 70-41, on Thursday Nos 40-11 before the top 10 on Friday completes this year’s list. The Top 100 rules are explained beneath the judges, who are listed in alphabetical order by category.

All the votes were added together to give a raw score. • To minimise the influence of outliers, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. • A player needed to receive votes from at least three judges to qualify. • If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. • We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating . • To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records are anonymised.
