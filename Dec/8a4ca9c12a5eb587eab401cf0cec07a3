Kevin De Bruyne is close to renewing his contract with Manchester City. The Belgian is happy at the club despite the team’s subdued start to the season and is poised to sign a new deal to stay at the Etihad Stadium until 2025. De Bruyne’s current contract runs to 2023 but with Pep Guardiola having recently renewed his deal with a further two years, to 2023, the 29-year-old feels confident that his future is at City. The midfielder is representing himself in the negotiations with the club and both parties are confident a deal will be reached soon. The talks were opened in October and there are only a few details remaining. De Bruyne is earning £300,000 a week including bonuses and expects to be given a small increase on that. City would be delighted to see the midfielder sign a contract extension, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain monitoring the situation closely. De Bruyne joined City in 2015 and has won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and four league cups.
