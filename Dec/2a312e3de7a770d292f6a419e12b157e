Just two days after the Swedish women’s champions announced their dissolution, Kopparbergs/Göteborg are back. The club received an “overwhelming” response from potential investors after announcing that they could no longer compete financially with major European teams. As a result, Gothenburg will defend their Swedish league title in 2021, the club said on New Year’s Eve. The team said, however, that their long-term concerns have not changed. Göteborg are not linked to a men’s team and fear they cannot compete at the elite level when major Swedish and European clubs have started spending more money on their women’s teams. With clubs such as Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus “having realised the value of women’s football … they are making large investments and have given women’s football resources that it’s impossible for us to match”, the club said on Tuesday. Potential new investors include private individuals, companies, and other football teams, Göteborg said. The club, which has been funded by the sponsorship of a local brewery, were eliminated from the Champions League this month when they lost to Manchester City in the last 32. The team won their first domestic league title this year, having finished second four times, and have also won the Swedish Cup three times.
