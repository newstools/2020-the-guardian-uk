1) It will soon be 2021. 2) The tantalising prospect – Covid-19-permitting – of a women’s World Cup and a British & Irish Lions summer tour in the coming year. 3) Making rugby a safer game to play and a better game to watch is now top of everybody’s agenda. New Zealand 15-25 Argentina – Sydney, 14 November. 1) Exeter Chiefs 31-27 Racing 92, Ashton Gate. A humdinger of a European final. 2) Bristol Bears 38-51 Clermont Auvergne, Ashton Gate. A glorious antidote to some drab autumn internationals. 3) Bristol Bears 22-25 Exeter Chiefs, Ashton Gate (again). A stirring display by Exeter’s dirt-trackers as Storm Francis raged. 1) Rob Baxter (Exeter).2) Lee Blackett (Wasps).3) Shaun Edwards (France). 1) Antoine Dupont (Toulouse and France).2) Sarah Bern (Bristol Bears and England).3) Sam Simmonds (Exeter)/Jack Willis (Wasps). 1) Justin Tipuric, Wales v England, Twickenham.

All outstanding ambassadors for their sport. 1=) Alfie Barbeary (Wasps), Gavin Coombes (Munster), Ioan Lloyd (Bristol). 1) “You see us lifting the World Cup and I can see me there jumping around. But I can’t remember it” – England’s 2003 World Cup winner Steve Thompson, who has been diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 42. 2) “Rugby is great for the soul, but terrible for the body” – Dylan Hartley, former England captain. 3) “It could be argued that the game turning professional in 1996 was the worst thing that could have happened in terms of player welfare” – Bill Ribbans, orthopaedic surgeon. 4) “We’d like to play like Viv Richards used to bat” – England head coach Eddie Jones. 5) “I said to him: ‘Mate, we’ve done it. We’re European champions. What are we going to do now?’ He said: ‘We’re going to do it again, aren’t we?’” – Exeter’s chairman, Tony Rowe, reveals his pitchside conversation with the director of rugby, Rob Baxter, immediately after the Chiefs’ Champions Cup final success. 1) Danny Cipriani.2) Steve Diamond.3) Saracens. 1) The lack of live crowds. You have been hugely missed. 2) Premiership Rugby. Some clear-eyed vision is way overdue. 3) England’s backline fluency. So much talent, currently stuck in an Umbro-designed straitjacket. 1) See you later, caterpillar. 2) No box-kicking permitted outside the 22 until the ball has been passed at least once. 3) A maximum of six replacements – not eight – allowed to join the fray. 1) A vaccine to help revive the semi-professional and community game. 2) Global support and assistance for Steve Thompson, Alix Popham, Michael Lipman, Adam Hughes, Neil Spence and every other retired player diagnosed with early onset dementia. 3) The overdue introduction of a fairer funding model that grants at least 10% of Test gate receipts to the away team.
