I love all of Crumpys vids, particularly this one. It’s a solid gold representation of what goes on in my head when fake small talk happens in my life or I just don’t understand what someone is talking about. I feel seen when I watch this video. Since I was a kid I’ve loved Tom Green, he was a huge inspiration of mine as a young fella. I love his relentless nonsense, it makes me feel almost safe to exist in a strange world. This video takes the brand Subway’s “as much salad bar as you like on your sandwich” rule to the bloody next level. I feel bad for the poor sandwich artist at times but respect him being a good sport and making such an insane sandwich for Greene. Lucinda Price (aka Froomes) is a total bloody champion and always makes hilarious short docos of herself taking the piss. Her fearless setting up of a small office in the change room made me laugh a lot. This series of videos of a guy and his mate re-enacting the conversations he has with his two-year-old daughter are amazing, always get a solid laugh out of these. Jordan has the most impressive Twitch stream I’ve ever seen and she is super funny too. The hook at the end of this track is a total banger. You probably can’t even kick flip either … This is hard to explain. A music duo that dress up like sausages and sing about types of sauce. What’s not to love? Will Sasso is a hilarious dude, from his stuff with Mad TV to now, he has always been able to make me double over in laughter. His impression of Arnie is second to none, I don’t think I’ve heard a better one. This video of him pretending to be in the Arctic is awesome. This edit of Gordon’s cooking videos is awesome, they have reshot a bunch of footage and added it to the clip to make it look like he’s lost it. It’s edited so well that it took me a second to work out that it was fake. Follow Nat’s What I Reckon on YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, or buy his book, Un-cook Yourself: A Ratbag’s Rules For Life
