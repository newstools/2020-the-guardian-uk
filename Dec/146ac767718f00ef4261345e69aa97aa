Even if the PM comes back from Brussels with a deal, it is going to be pretty thin gruel compared with the delightful oven-ready meal he promised. In four years’ time, when there is another general election, much else will have happened to absorb voters’ attention, but sadly many “red wall” voters are likely to have discovered that their lives have been further levelled down rather than up, and that at least part of the reason will lie with Brexit (This is the last exit to Brexit. But in truth, there was only ever one road, 8 December). So why would Labour want to be associated with this disaster?
