The Argentina captain, Pablo Matera, must undergo educational training and community service in order to remain a part of the national team setup. Matera, along with his international teammates Guido Petti and Santiago Socino, was suspended for racist remarks he had made on social media between 2011 and 2013, before being reinstated two days later. After an investigation, the Argentine Rugby Union decided that all three players must undergo the training, with Matera barred from the captaincy until it is completed. The inquiry took into account the fact the comments were published some years ago but concluded that the damage caused “should be remedied” through “restorative measures”. In an effort to tighten its own disciplinary framework around discriminatory expressions, it was decided that Matera, Petti and Socino must take part in a six-hour course taking place over three days to become aware of “where prejudices arise and the consequences they have in relationships between people”. As part of this they will record a video with educational content on “discriminatory stereotypes and prejudices”, which will be used as a reference resource for the players, and must spend two days with other players who take the course. An ARU statement said: “The eligibility of the three players is subject to compliance with the restorative measures imposed and this board of directors withdraws the endorsement of Pablo Matera’s captaincy until the restorative measures are satisfactorily completed.”
