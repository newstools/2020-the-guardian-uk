Whether you managed to safely holiday abroad and found a special place, or you stayed in the UK and happened on a local gem that’s formed part of your lockdown routine, we would love to hear your travel discovery highlights of the year. It could be a cafe or treasure trove of a shop that adapted to this year’s special circumstances, a lovely park that you’d never been to before, a monument or area of woodland. Perhaps you climbed hills and mountains and found an incredible view or visited a nature reserve and saw something extraordinary. Whatever it is, please share your experiences. If you have a photo, do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe.
