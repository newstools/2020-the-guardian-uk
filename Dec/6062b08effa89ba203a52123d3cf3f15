Christmas and New Year celebrations will take place on a much smaller scale in 2020 – but that doesn’t guarantee they’ll be hangover-free. As many of us will have discovered in recent months, it’s just as easy to over-indulge when you’re pouring your own drinks at home. So as we toast the end of what has been a particularly difficult year, we’re keen to hear your tips for avoiding a sore head in the morning. Perhaps you swear by a particular meal to set you straight? Or maybe you advocate a morning swim to clear the cobwebs? If you’ve got a hangover cure that you find works every time, then we want to hear about it. You can get in touch by filling in the form below.
