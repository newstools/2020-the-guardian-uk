The classic French vermouth, Noilly Prat, is made in the pretty seaside village of Marseillan in Provence, so I used some of the local flavours to create this refreshing cocktail. For the shallot syrup25g very finely chopped shallot125ml standard 2:1 sugar syrup For the drink50ml Noilly Prat Original Dry Vermouth20ml lemon juice20ml shallot syrup (see above)1 egg white2 tsp (10ml) brine from a jar or tin of good green olives½ tsp (2.5ml) white-wine vinegarSoda water, to topLemon peel, to finish First make the syrup. In a dry frying pan over a medium heat, toast the chopped shallot, stirring often, for about five minutes, until nicely golden brown all over. Tip the shallots into a small saucepan, add the sugar syrup and heat on the lowest possible flame, so it’s barely bubbling, for two hours. Turn off the heat, leave to infuse overnight, then strain and decant into a small jar. Seal and refrigerate until needed (it will keep in the fridge for up to a month). To build the drink, put everything bar the soda water and lemon peel in a shaker, then dry shake (ie, with no ice) to set the egg white and incorporate it fully. Add a handful of ice to the shaker, shake again to chill the cocktail, then double strain into a a collins or highball glass. Top with soda water, squeeze the lemon peel over the top, to express its essential oils (discard the peel afterwards), and serve. • Nico de Soto, founder Danico, Paris
