Alexander Sørloth’s stoppage-time goal earned RB Leipzig a potentially precious 4-3 win over Istanbul Basaksehir, after the German side had squandered a two-goal lead in Turkey. The visitors began on the front foot, chasing a victory to boost their hopes of qualifying from Group H, and took the lead when Marcel Sabitzer’s shot deflected in off Yussuf Poulsen. Nordi Mukiele added a second from Emil Forsberg’s assist, but Basaksehir midfielder Irfan Kahveci cut the deficit just before half-time. Dani Olmo looked to have secured victory for Leipzig, but Kahveci struck again in the 72nd minute and completed a memorable hat-trick with a sumptuous left-footed free kick in the 85th minute. With time running out, Sørloth drilled home to snatch victory. Leipzig moved to nine points, level with Group H leaders Manchester United who face PSG later on Wednesday. Julian Nagelsmann’s side host United in their final group game. In the other early kick-off, Krasnodar earned their first Champions League win and secured Europa League qualification with a 1-0 home win over Rennes. Marcus Berg fired in the winner in a game between two sides already out of contention in Group E.
