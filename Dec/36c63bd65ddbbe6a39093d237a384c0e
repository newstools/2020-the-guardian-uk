The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will receive the Sputnik V vaccine against coronavirus, the Kremlin spokesman told state TV channel Rossiya 1. “He said he will be vaccinated, he made this decision and was waiting until all formalities are completed,” said Dmitry Peskov. The country launched a voluntary vaccination programme with the Russia-made vaccine earlier in December, starting with the most vulnerable groups in Moscow. People over the age of 60 may begin to apply for shots on Monday, Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said on his website on Sunday, a day after the Russian health ministry said the vaccine was approved for use by elderly people following a separate trial. Putin, 68, had said earlier that Sputnik V was effective and safe, seeing no reason for people not to be vaccinated, adding he was waiting until it became available. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Russia, Putin has mainly worked remotely, held meetings via videolink and has limited travel. In August he said one of his daughters had taken part in the clinical trial of the vaccine and felt well afterwards.
