Since Diego Maradona’s death in November, countless tributes have been paid to the Argentinian maestro and World Cup winner from fellow icons within the game. His long-time rival Pelé wrote a poignant message on Instagram: “Many people loved to compare us all their lives. You were a genius that enchanted the world. A magician with the ball at his feet. A true legend … I want to say that you are incomparable.” His compatriot and mentee Lionel Messi wrote: “He leaves us but does not leave because Diego is eternal.” But it’s a quote from Maradona himself which seems most apt when recalling his famous exploits for La Albiceleste: “No matter what happens and no matter who is in charge, the No 10 shirt will always be mine.” Photograph: Mark Leech / Offside Words: Jonny Weeks Buy your exclusive print here Price £55 including free delivery (30x40cm print size).
