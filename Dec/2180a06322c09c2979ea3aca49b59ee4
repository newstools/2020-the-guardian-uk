The landscape is laid bare in winter. It’s all about the natural architecture of the land and the silhouettes of the trees, made dramatic and exhilarating by a touch of frost, a dusting of snow or brittle sunlight. Please tell us about your favourite winter landscape in Europe including the UK; it could be somewhere you’ve discovered or revisited regularly during lockdown, or somewhere further afield that holds a special memory. And if getting to it involves a hike, than tell us about that too. If you have a photo of the landscape, do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and maybe the paper too. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
