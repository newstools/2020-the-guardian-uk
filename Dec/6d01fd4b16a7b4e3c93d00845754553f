Mauricio Pochettino is set to replace Thomas Tuchel as Paris Saint-Germain’s head coach after the German was sacked on Thursday, with the champions in seven of the past eight seasons sitting third in Ligue 1. Pochettino has reached an agreement with PSG to take over, with only a few details to be ironed out before his appointment is confirmed. The Argentinian, who has been out of football since being sacked by Tottenham in November 2019, is thought to be very keen on taking over at the Qatar-owned club.

He departs after a 4-0 home win over Strasbourg on Wednesday, with PSG’s sporting director, Leonardo, first sounding out Pochettino’s representatives this week. In his post-match press conference on Wednesday, Tuchel addressed comments made in an interview with German TV channel Sport1. Tuchel was quoted as saying he felt more like “a sports politician than a coach” in his first year at PSG, but insisted that the quote was an inaccurate translation of a light-hearted comment. The former Dortmund manager was appointed head coach in June 2018, replacing Unai Emery. Tuchel, 47, won two Ligue 1 titles, completing a domestic treble last season, and in August this year led PSG to their first ever Champions League final, which they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich.
