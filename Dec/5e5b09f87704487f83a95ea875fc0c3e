Perhaps we should call this new Covid-19 variant the “Grinch strain”. As coronavirus in a mutated, more contagious form scuppers plans for festive gatherings, the front pages can do little to hang a bauble on the news. At least you could buy a copy of all today’s papers to keep you occupied during the times of suppressed joy ahead. Puzzle specials, added sections and other extras abound in these final Sunday editions before Christmas … The Mail asks: “Will this nightmare ever end?”, adding that Christmas plans have been “shattered for 16m” and emphasising that the PM “faces Tory anger” over the decision. The Mirror lays the blame squarely at the PM’s feet with a combination of “Lost Xmas”, “Boris U-turns yet again” and “Public fury over last-gasp change of mind” – though it does concede “Covid super strain threatens to sweep country”. The Observer has “Johnson U-turn leaves nation’s plans for Christmas in tatters” and a pointer to its comment section: “The right decision – made at the wrong time and in the wrong way”. There’s a splash of colour with the puzzles special inside promoted above the masthead. The Sunday Times also brightens things with a promo for its “lockdown TV and streaming guide” but there’s no getting away from the story of the day: “Christmas is cancelled by surging mutant virus”. Its political editor, Tim Shipman, reassesses Boris Johnson: “Cavalier PM is now a sad, sober Roundhead” (Wikipedia is your friend here). The Sunday Telegraph has the same picture of Johnson and the headline “Christmas cancelled for millions”. From Scotland, the Herald gives us: “As new Covid variant spreads … Bubble bursts on Christmas gatherings”. The Express has “Fast-spreading Covid-19 wrecks Christmas” attributing it to the “terrifying new virus strain”.
