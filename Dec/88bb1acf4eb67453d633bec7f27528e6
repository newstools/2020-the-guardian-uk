Teased on Twitter several months back, Rina Sawayama’s collaboration with Lady Gaga’s favourite producer BloodPop delivers everything a great pop song should: gushing lyrics about intoxicating love, sultry whispered interludes and a stupidly upbeat chorus that will sound incredible when we’re finally allowed back in the club. If Rina doesn’t get her props for this at next year’s awards ceremonies, we need to stage a serious coup. Pitched somewhere between Brockhampton and a balladeering version of the 1975, Life Goes On sees BTS flex their “heartfelt farewell single” muscle without actually having to split up. Their emotional stimulus? A coronavirus-era contemplation of distance and longing, like a well-coiffed group of Gen-Z Vera Lynns. As always, BTS demonstrate a MasterChef level of cheese control. Indie bros, I’ve got some bad news: comparing Jack Antonoff’s Chinatown to anything from Taylor Swift’s impeccable Folklore will quickly confirm just who boasts the bulk of the songwriting skills in their creative relationship. Nonetheless, when Antonoff recruits some plucky newbie called Bruce Springsteen for a whiskey-soaked weekender of a chorus, he ends up with something weirdly festive and irresistible. Freshly squeezed in Leeds, Straight Girl’s sour, pulsing take on EDM feels fitting for These Unprecedented Times™, when endless “What are you up to?” “Not much really” conversations threaten to drive you mad just as readily as they offer relief. Take a night off the Zoom calls and have a kitchen dance to this instead. That’s proper self-care. To say that Megan Thee Stallion is raunchy is akin to calling water wet, but her charm very much lies in her humour. Like an NSFW Baby Shark, the chory-ory-ory-chorus of Body will stalk you in your dreams, but the celebratory relentlessness of its syncopated sexual groans and pants will twitch even the most underdeveloped twerking muscles.
