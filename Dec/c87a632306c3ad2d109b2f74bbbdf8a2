After an extraordinary year when few of us managed any overseas trips, many people are developing seriously itchy feet. In a spirit of hope about the less-restricted world we may start to be able to enjoy, we’d love you to share your holiday hopes and dreams for 2021. You may be heading back to a much-missed favourite destination or ticking something off a bucket list suspended by the pandemic. Hopefully some of us will remember how skies cleared and pollution fell last spring and opt for some sort of low-carbon dream fulfilment. If you have a photo of your dream spot do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe.
