Taiwan has reported its first local coronavirus transmission since 12 April, blaming a foreign pilot for ending 253 virus-free days. Health authorities said a woman in her thirties had tested positive after contact with the pilot, a New Zealander working for a Taiwanese airline who was confirmed to have been infected on Sunday having flown flights to the US. The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said the pilot had failed to “truthfully declare” his contacts and activities to authorities once he had been confirmed as a carrier. Authorities said the pilot – who faces a fine of up to NT$300,000 ($10,600) – visited several establishments including a department store. The infection is a blow for an island that has been lauded for its pandemic response, having recorded just 770 coronavirus cases and seven deaths after it shut its borders early and implemented strict quarantine rules. Since 12 April, all positive cases have been from a small number of locals returning to the island and also among the few foreigners and migrant workers allowed in for business reasons. The vast majority of arrivals have to quarantine for two weeks and must test negative, a measure which – until Tuesday – had successfully kept any carriers from introducing the virus to the local community. Pilots, however, undergo a less strict three days of self-quarantine after each overseas trip and the new case has already sparked debate about whether those measures should be tightened. Soon after the virus first emerged in central China, Taiwan shut its borders, ramped up mask production and rolled out a well-oiled track and trace programme. Within two months of its first outbreak, local infections had ceased. Throughout the year the island of 24 million people has managed to avoid the widespread lockdown and closures that have blighted the rest of the world. Taiwan is on track to grow its economy by 2.5% this year.
