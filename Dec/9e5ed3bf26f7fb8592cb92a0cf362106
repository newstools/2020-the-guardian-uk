This photograph captures Bobby Moore in 1973, standing statuesque in the twilight of his international career, just a few months after winning his 100th cap for England. It was shot prior to a 1-0 friendly win over Scotland which would prove to be Moore’s final victory in an England shirt at Wembley. It possesses a kind of majesty reminiscent of the bronze statue of him at the new Wembley, beneath which an inscription reads: ‘Immaculate footballer. Imperial defender. Immortal hero of 1966. First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft. Favourite son of London’s East End. Finest legend of West Ham United. National Treasure. Master of Wembley. Lord of the game. Captain extraordinary. Gentleman of all time.’ Photograph: Gerry Cranham / Offside Words: Jonny Weeks Buy your exclusive print here Price £55 including free delivery (30x40cm print size).
