Surely a more effective way of persuading sufficient people to be vaccinated (NHS to enlist ‘sensible’ celebrities to persuade people to take coronavirus vaccine, 29 November) is the one said to be under consideration by some airlines – namely, no vaccination certificate, no entry. If the conspiracy theorists, Covid deniers and plain selfish who want someone else to test it before they have it were presented with the choice of either being vaccinated or being denied the right to board an aircraft, train or coach, and denied access to motorway service areas, I think the uptake would be well over 90%. Alan WhitehousePenistone, South Yorkshire • Following the news that the vaccine taskforce has already spent £670,000 on PR, I would like to know: will the celebrities and “influencers” do this for free, for the good of humanity, or will they be paid large sums out of overstretched public health funds?
