It’s 20 December, the day before the shortest day, when the nights are long and the sun is low and much gardening is largely redundant. Your last chance to pop to the vegetable plot to pick a few winter leaves or brassicas, cavolo nero or brussels sprouts – though the tops are superior for eating in my opinion – for Christmas dinner. Perhaps even unearth a few parsnips for roasting, if they are to your taste. Nearly past time to get in a few late requests for presents. I will often ask the kids or other family for seed packets. As always, I also have my eye on the Brown Envelope Seeds gift boxes, perhaps Peas on Earth, the Purple Veg, maybe even the Brexit Box. But you will have to hurry, unless like me you also have a birthday soon. If someone loves you a lot, then perhaps drop a heavy hint about Implementations tools. They are the best in Britain, to my taste. Beautifully crafted blades from bronze and copper. We have acquired a few over the years, from the versatile two-pronged handheld Phoenix hoe, my go-to tool, and various trowels to a large rake and a spade. I often tell myself I am saving up for the full-size fork. I have had a yen for more fruit trees, too, in Denmark. There, we have pears and apples, but no plum, and I sometimes yearn for a ‘Reine Claude’. But I know I have to stop sometime. And if I don’t, Henri, my sensible wife, will tell me. Whatever you are wishing for, many garden centres and growers and gardening suppliers have had their toughest-ever year, so maybe try to make up for it a little if you can in 2021, but perhaps also try to buy from smaller businesses. It just leaves me now to wish you all, wherever you are, a very merry Christmas and to thank you for listening in. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.
