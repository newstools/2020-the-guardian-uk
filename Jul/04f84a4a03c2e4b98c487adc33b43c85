With the arts struggling to adapt to the post-lockdown world more than many other sectors, a great way to get a culture fix this summer is at an outdoor cinema or theatre. So this week we’re asking for your recommendations. It could be a pop-up in the UK on a beach or in a park, or maybe a summer theatre in a Roman arena, or one of the established outdoor cinemas (with films in English) that are popular in Europe’s warm, southern cities. Before you submit your tip, please ensure that that particular cinema or theatre is open this summer, and include a website if possible and location details. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. Please keep your tip to about 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
