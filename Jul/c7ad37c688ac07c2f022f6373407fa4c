Emma Lilley (Letters, 26 July) inquires about humming or vocalising as a way to get back to singing. The master of wordless choral composition was, of course, Frederick Delius. Lilley’s choir might like to investigate the first of Delius’s two part-songs, To Be Sung of a Summer Night on the Water. Ravishing harmonies, but no words!  Nick Chadwick Oxford • The book everyone should be reading is William McNeill’s Plagues and Peoples (Not the Booker prize 2020, 20 July). It describes how diseases have changed societies, and includes fascinating stuff about the emergence of measles and smallpox, and a convincing link between endemic disease, invasion from abroad and the Indian caste system.Mary RooksLeicester • Like Sue Rogers (Letters, 26 July) I’m wearing a mask indoors in all public spaces, but also outdoors, as repeatedly touching one to take it off and put it on again is inadvisable. I’ve made several from old shirts, and I now feel underdressed without one. I have them in various colours to match whatever else I’m wearing.Dr Katy JennisonWitney, Oxfordshire • Cricket is therapeutic, wherever you watch (‘It’s lovely to be here’: county cricket fans return to the Oval, 26 July). I’ve been to Lord’s, but learned to score, aged 12, at a village match, taught by an elderly gent. Good training for maths and concentration.Margaret WaddyCambridge • Why pick on China for “rewriting the facts about Covid-19 to suit its own narrative” (Carrie Gracie, 27 July)? That’s what Boris Johnson is doing.Peter BrookerWest Wickham, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
