If you had to pair me with a chocolate, it would not be a bar of white, non-dairy milk, turmeric-matcha-tea chocolate. That’s pretty much everything I’m not into. And yet, I loved it. This is why one must keep an open mind – and not just about chocolate. Knowledge is never finite. This particular bar was made by Luisa’s Artisan Chocolates, based in Nottingham, as part of her Casholate range that uses cashew nuts to provide creaminess. But most of the chocolate Luisa produces is plain, simple and spectacular. This is the place if you like your chocolate dark, ethical and really interesting. Luisa uses cashew nuts for creaminess You can choose a box of chocolates by picking the centres individually (£7.50 for six). Described as truffles, many are not what I would describe as truffles, but hard-centred - no less desirable but be prepared; the ginger, for example, is a crystallised piece enrobed in dark chocolate. If you want soft, go for the salted or chocolate caramels, which have the appropriate ooze and are very good (£11.50 for 12). The bars start small, 25g for around the £2.50 mark. Perfect daily ration size. My favourite was Martha’s 66% Colombian, as close to the ideal dark as I’ve discovered: astonishingly good. The 72% Ecuador and 72% Madagascan were super fruity; you’ll be very satisfied with just one piece. The latter was an Academy of Chocolate Award winner last year. The 92% Cacao Philippines won gold, but is a bit too dark for me. That said, the 100% Solomon Islands could square up to Firetree. luisasveganchocolates.co.uk
