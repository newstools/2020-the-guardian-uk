• Could Feast stop starting recipes with “Set the oven to X degrees C”. In some recipes the oven wasn’t used until the next day. Last week, a Peshwari naan recipe set the oven at 200C when the oven wasn’t used for four hours (Feast, 11 July). I have written several times (by post), but answer there was none.Hugh EdwardsGrange-over-Sands, Cumbria • Can I suggest an old-fashioned surgical technique for Geraldine Blake’s mask problem (Letters, 9 July). Take off the elastic and fasten a 35cm length of tape to each corner of the mask. Tie the two top tapes round the back of the head low down, and the two bottom tapes towards the top of the head. It is comfortable and also helps to reduce glasses steaming up.Janet PorterSutton, Ely • Peter Bradshaw has embraced drive-ins and thinks they should be “a showcase for classic movies, foreign movies, or little-known gems” (Our film critic’s first drive-in: ‘I quietly squeak with excitement’, 9 July). They are the sort of films I pay to see at my local cinema. But should they now be unavailable to me just because I don’t have a car?Sue BallBrighton • I haven’t been to a drive-in since I was a child, but we always wiped the windscreen with half a raw potato in case of rain (Letters, 12 July).Belinda KingAssington, Sudbury • Re the letter from Patrick Wallace (12 July), could I suggest “idiocracy” as my contribution to the descriptors of this government?Don JenkinPenzance, Cornwall
