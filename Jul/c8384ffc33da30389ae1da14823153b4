Drivers are being reminded to check their car’s MOT status after the government said all testing must return to normal on 1 August. After the country went into lockdown, ministers immediately suspended the requirement for motorists to take their vehicle for it annual MOT inspection. Instead all cars, vans and motorbikes with an MOT due to expire between 30 March and 31 July had the deadline by which they needed a new one extended by six months. To confuse motorists checking the expiry date for their car, the extension was only added a week before the original expiry date. That means if your car’s MOT was due to expire on 20 July, it will still show that date until until about 13 July at which point it will updated to 20 January 2021. Those who are unsure of their vehicle’s status can check its expiry date using the Check-mot.service.gov.uk website. For MOTs due on or after 1 August, the government has said the original deadline will stand and no further extension will be added. Only vehicles three years and older require the annual safety and emissions inspection. It you take your car to be MOTed after the original expiry, but before the extended date, it cannot be driven if it fails. It can only be driven again once it has passed another test. Lee Griffin of price comparison website GoCompare said drivers who used the extension to knowingly drive a car with safety defects could still be prosecuted. “Drivers are responsible for their cars’ condition and they are expected to carry out regular safety checks to ensure that it is safe and roadworthy,” he said. “We are urging drivers not to ignore any dashboard warning lights and, if they have any concerns about the condition of their car to take it to be repaired. Garages have been classified as essential businesses so are open for repairs, MOTs and routine servicing.”
