Many of us have found ourselves dressing differently during lockdown. Perhaps you previously wore a suit to the office but are now opting for something more relaxed while working from home. Or maybe you used to get dressed up to go out on the town, but haven’t ventured further than your back garden lately? Has lockdown made you ditch your jeans, or invest in luxury loungewear? Are waistbands and lace-up shoes a thing of your fashion past – or, on the other hand, have you been striving for normality by wearing your Sunday best to the supermarket? Either way, we want to know about your newly formed fashion habits, why you’ve made changes, and if you think they’ll stick as lockdown begins to ease.
