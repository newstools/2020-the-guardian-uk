This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Stirling Smith Art Gallery & Museum. The museum was founded in 1874 with the bequest and collection of the artist Thomas Stuart Smith. Today, its collection contains more than 40,000 objects, artworks and photographs spanning thousands of years, from local archaeological finds to 19th-century European art.
