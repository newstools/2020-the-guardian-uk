This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum, located inside the 200-year-old Royal Pump Rooms, one of the town’s original bath houses. It holds in its collections over 13,000 art works and historic artefacts of local, regional and national significance, for the enjoyment and inspiration of the people of Warwick district and beyond.
