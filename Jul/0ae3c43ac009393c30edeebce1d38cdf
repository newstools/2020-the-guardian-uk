Your tribute to Jenni Murray (Jenni Murray to quit BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, 24 July) left out one of her most significant contributions to a whole generation of her contemporaries, including me. Her throwaway comment during a broadcast at the turn of the millennium – “Is it me or is it hot in here” – produced not only an avalanche of readers’ letters, but also a wonderful book of the same name. The menopause became something we could talk about. Thanks, Jenni.Lindy HardcastleGroby, Leicestershire • Our choir, Kington Choral Society, is desperate to get back to rehearsals. We wondered if humming or vocalising (with vowel sounds) might generate fewer aerosol particles. Perhaps researchers (Sing into the funnel please: inside the Covid-19 lab hoping to declare singing safe, 22 July) could look into it?Emma LilleyPresteigne, Powys • Salads that need cooking, ingredients that never find their way to our neck of the woods (Feast, 25 July). Can I give your recipe writers a challenge? Come to Dewsbury, go to one supermarket, and buy all the ingredients for a meal. Then I might give it a go.Alison EvansDewsbury, West Yorkshire • Re graffiti outside Trinity College, Oxford, in the 1960s (Letters, 23 July), during the seamen’s strike, the hoarding also exhorted passersby to “Save our Semen”.Gerald L MilchLondon • Declan O’Neill is wrong to criticise the crossword setter for giving “vulgar” as a clue for “plebeian” (Letters, 24 July). Vulgar Latin was not coarse language, but the Latin of ordinary people.Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, France
