The UK’s love of cycling has grown rapidly in recent years – Olympic glory seems to have helped with that! Though that doesn’t mean that all journeys have to be record-setting lung-busters. Perhaps, you have a favourite coast or countryside route; or maybe it’s something that goes, safely, from urban to rural without tackling the roads. With news that the National Cycle Network is cutting a quarter of its routes on safety grounds, we would love your ideas for safe, family-friendly, off-road UK trails that are perfect to explore together. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. Please keep your tip to about 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
