Tom Meighan has announced that he is leaving Kasabian, the Leicester rock band he co-founded as a student in the late 90s. The band shared a brief statement on Meighan’s departure, describing the decision as one taken by mutual consent. Meighan had “struggled with personal issues that have affected his behaviour for quite some time and now wants to concentrate all his energies on getting his life back on track,” said the statement. The group said it would not comment further. Following the announcement, Meighan thanked fans for their support and said he was doing well: “I’m in a really good place now.” Meighan formed one of contemporary British indie’s most recognisable pairings alongside bandmate Serge Pizzorno, backed by bassist Chris Edwards and drummer Ian Matthews. They are one of the few enduring acts from the mid-2000s British indie rock wave. Mixing psychedelia and noise rock, their 2004 debut earned them comparisons to the Prodigy. They released their sixth album, For Crying Out Loud, in 2017. That year, Meighan told Q magazine that he had been struggling with his mental health following the death of a friend and splitting from his partner. “I was making myself ill, I ain’t gonna lie, my mind was jolted. It might have been a build-up from years and years. I wasn’t taking responsibility and it affected everyone around me, horrendous.” In 2019, Pizzorno released his debut solo album under the name the SLP. He said the record emerged after Kasabian decided to give themselves a rare period of time off. Last month, Meighan told Sky News that Kasabian were working on a sixth album that they hoped to record once lockdown lifted. He also said he was at work on a solo album that he described as “very autobiographical … It’s kind of heartbreaking.”
