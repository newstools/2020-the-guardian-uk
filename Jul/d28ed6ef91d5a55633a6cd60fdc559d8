World Rugby’s decision to double the length of the international window in the autumn following the cancellation of the summer tours to the south may become the norm as further talks on a global calendar are planned. There will be six Test weekends from 24 October and one rest week, allowing the Six Nations to be completed before the Rugby Championship is staged in one country in the south and the Six Nations are joined by Japan and Fiji for a tournament in Europe. World Rugby’s approval of the Test window being extended means clubs will be obliged to release players under regulation nine. The governing body’s attention will now turn to the global calendar and plans to synchronise the seasons in the two hemispheres. “All parties, including unions, club competitions and players, remain committed to continued dialogue regarding the long-term harmonisation of the international calendar for the betterment of all,” World Rugby said in a statement. It would mean club seasons starting at the end of December, and October and November being reserved for Tests which would be given a competitive hue, replacing the current series of friendlies. Tournaments would be played in blocks, ending overlaps. The eight nations tournament this autumn is a prototype. There will be two groups of four, before the final weekend’s fixtures between teams who occupy the same finishing position in the other pool. The Six Nations is expected to finalise details next week. England, Wales, Ireland and Fiji are expected to be in one pool with France, Scotland, Japan and Italy joining the second. “The tournament is still not 100% confirmed,” said Fiji’s new head coach, Vern Cotter. “It changes daily, which is only natural because it’s an uncertain landscape. We’ll be delighted to be involved but we’re waiting for the boxes to be ticked. I just wonder how we got into the pool with England, Wales and Ireland when Japan, Italy and Scotland are all lower in the world rankings.”
