When interviewing Ennio Morricone in 2006, I observed how prolific he was. This clearly raised the odd hackle, as he replied: “I often say that compared with composers such as Bach and Mozart I am practically unemployed! I am simply driven by passion and love for music and composition.” A genuine gripe was the oft-used expression Spaghetti Westerns, for which he wrote some of his most memorable scores. “The correct term,” he told me very firmly, “is Italian Westerns.”
