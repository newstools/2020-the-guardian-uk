Authorities in France will investigate claims that human corpses donated for science were left to rot and be eaten by rats at a university research facility, the Paris prosecutor’s office has said. An investigation into “violations of the integrity of a corpse” was handed over to magistrates by prosecutors who handled the initial phase of the investigation after l’Express magazine reported the scandal last November. The newspaper said the remains of thousands of people who donated them for research were discovered in abhorrent conditions at the Centre for Body Donations (CDC) of Paris Descartes University. Bodies were strewn around naked, dismembered, piled one on top of the other, with a severed head lying on the floor, l’Express reported, describing the scene, photographed in 2016, as resembling a mass grave. Some body parts were decomposing, others lay there chewed by rats amid overflowing bin bags containing pieces of flesh. Frederic Douchez, a lawyer for families who pressed charges, said of Thursday’s announcement: “This is very good news.” Investigating magistrates, he said, had much wider powers to get to the bottom of the affair. Nearly 80 complaints have so far been lodged. The revelations caused the French government to order the shuttering of the centre and an administrative inspection by a panel which said in June the university was guilty of “serious ethical breaches” in its management of the CDC. The centre, opened in 1953, was the largest of its kind in Europe, and until its closure received hundreds of donated bodies every year.
