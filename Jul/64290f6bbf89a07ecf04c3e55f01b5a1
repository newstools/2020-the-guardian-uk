An inquest is to be opened into the death of a London teenager whose body was found in dense rainforest in Malaysia after she disappeared from a resort. The unclothed body of 15-year-old Nora Quoirin was discovered in August last year after a large-scale search near where she had been on holiday with her family. Nora was born with holoprosencephaly, a neurological disorder that affects brain development, and her family described her as vulnerable. Her parents have said they believed there was a criminal element to her death. The teenager had learning difficulties and would not have wandered off alone, they said. Malaysian police insisted there was no sign of foul play. Nora disappeared a day after arriving at the Dusun resort near Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, triggering a 10-day search involving hundreds of people, helicopters and sniffer dogs. An autopsy found Nora probably starved and died of internal bleeding after about a week in the jungle. Authorities classified the case as “requiring no further action” but her family pushed for an inquest. Speaking in December, Nora’s mother, Meabh, said: “For us, something very complex happened. We have insisted from the beginning that we believe there was a criminal element to what happened.” A coroner has set the inquest to run from 24 August until 4 September, the family’s lawyer, Sankara Nair, said. Sixty-four witnesses will be called and the coroner, prosecutors and lawyers will visit the area where her body was found before it gets under way, he said. Nair said the inquest would be streamed via Zoom “for the parents of Nora and other witnesses living abroad to follow the proceedings”.
