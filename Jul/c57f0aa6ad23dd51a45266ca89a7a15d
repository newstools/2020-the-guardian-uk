Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. It’s my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary in late September and we want a celebration, but we don’t know what to do. What can we arrange that won’t involve losing money if we have to cancel? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
