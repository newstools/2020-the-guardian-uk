David Dunn has been appointed as the manager of newly-promoted League Two side Barrow. The former Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham City attacking midfielder has signed a two-year contract after leaving his role as a first-team coach at Blackpool. Dunn replaces Ian Evatt, who left to take over at Bolton Wanderers last week. Evatt had led Barrow to the Conference title and a return to the Football League after 48 years away. Dunn’s first challenge will be to keep the team in League Two after they won promotion on a points-per-game basis. “As soon as we knew David was available and wanted the position we made him our number one target,” said the Barrow chairman, Paul Hornby. “He is an extremely talented coach and ticked all the boxes with the owners. “His football philosophy and style of play is completely suited to how we are set up and he also knows a number of our players, which met our requirements for a seamless transition,” Hornby added. “After meeting David we knew he would be the man to take the club onto the next level.” Dunn left Blackburn’s under-23 side to join Blackpool in January of this year, and became caretaker manager when Simon Grayson was sacked. He was kept on at Bloomfield Road when Neil Critchley was appointed as the club’s new manager in March. The 40-year-old has earned his Uefa ‘A’ coaching licence after a playing career that saw him play 382 games with Blackburn, Birmingham and Oldham. Dunn also earned a single England cap in 2002.
