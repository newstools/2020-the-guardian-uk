Before synod members criticise their bishops for tweeting about Dominic Cummings (Church of England bishops criticised over Cummings tweets, 8 July), they should reflect on the church’s history.

Did he have access to minutes of one of those early Cobra meetings?Denis AhernStanford-le-Hope, Essex • Lovely to see that Adrian Chiles recommends The Köln Concert by Keith Jarrett (I’ve started listening to my friends’ music recommendations – shame no one’s asked for mine, 8 July).

Then you know you’ve really got problems. There’s only so much space behind the average ear.Geraldine BlakeWorthing, Sussex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
