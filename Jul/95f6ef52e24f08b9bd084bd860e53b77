Halle Berry has dropped out of playing a trans character after online disquiet following an interview in which she discussed the role. Berry posted a note on social media saying: “Over the weekend I had the opportunity to discuss my consideration of an upcoming role as a transgender man, and I’d like to apologize for those remarks. As a cisgender woman, I now understand that I should not have considered this role, and that the transgender community should undeniably have the opportunity to tell their own stories.” The move followed an interview on Friday on Instagram with hair stylist Christin Brown, during which Berry discussed a trans man role she was planning to take on in an un-named film. Berry said: “[It’s] a character where the woman is a trans character, so she’s a woman that transitioned into a man. She’s a character in a project I love that I might be doing … Who this woman was is so interesting to me, and that will probably be my next project.” However, Berry’s reference to the character as a “woman” and “she” sparked considerable backlash on social media, sparking accusations of misgendering. Berry’s decision to drop out was welcomed by leading LGBTQ activist group Glaad, which tweeted: “We are pleased that @halleberry listened to the concerns of transgender people and learned from them. Other powerful people should do the same.” Berry’s decision follows Scarlett Johansson’s exit from Rub & Tug in 2018, a biopic of massage parlour operator Dante “Tex” Gill, after similar protests from trans activists.
