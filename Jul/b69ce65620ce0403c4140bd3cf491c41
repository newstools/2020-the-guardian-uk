Andrea Atzeni has had to go to Newbury for a couple of nice rides but he could be feeling a bit wistful as he watches York’s John Smith’s Cup, as Fifth Position (2.30) has a fine chance in the big-field handicap, the highlight of ITV4’s Saturday coverage. A sizeable sort with a half-brother who jumps fences, he was crying out for a step up to this distance before scoring at Doncaster last month.A bigger field and a stronger pace can help Roger Varian’s gelding take the step forward he needs here. It’s worth remembering the two horses who beat him on his seasonal return at Newcastle both won Royal Ascot handicaps next time. He must overcome a wide draw. Afaak, from stall one, may get a better tow into the race and is worth considering each-way.1.55 York The Melrose didn’t work out well for him last year but Universal Order’s stalk-and-pounce tactics have been productive in small fields and this Silver Cup may work out well for him, with Communique to set the pace. Moonlight Spirit has to be treated with caution after a most disappointing effort in the Gold Cup.2.15 Newbury Well supported, Method won easily on his Doncaster debut three weeks ago and the runner-up has since been second in the Cherry Hinton. This is a hot contest but it is hard to get away from Martyn Meade’s chestnut.2.50 Newbury This step up to a mile at a flatter track looks like good news for Tomorrow’s Dream, who finished powerfully after taking a while to find top gear at Chepstow last month.3.05 York “Hopefully, we’ve found another aeroplane,” was Paul Mulrennan’s line after riding Que Amoro to a Listed success. This is a big chance for the pacy frontrunner to prove it against Equilateral, who ran respectably in defeat in the July Cup last weekend. Alpha Delphini would be hard to beat at his very best but is nine and has had one run since October 2018.3.25 Newbury She was a beaten favourite but Virgin Snow still ran with credit at Newcastle last month, when the winner was allowed to set a steady pace. A bigger field and an extra quarter-mile could be the recipe for Snow Fairy’s daughter to get back in the winner’s enclosure in this Aphrodite Stakes, a race normally run at Newmarket.3.40 York There was some depth to the Goodwood maiden won by Make My Day last summer, with Caravan Of Hope among those behind. Gelded since then, the son of Galileo is fairly rated for this first handicap.4.00 Newbury Old-timers The Tin Man and Judicial dominate the betting forecast but Tinto, half their age, is progressing into a horse worth consideration at this level. A 40-1 handicap winner last month, he was flying at the finish in the Coral Charge, having blown the start. This return to six furlongs gives him every chance.
