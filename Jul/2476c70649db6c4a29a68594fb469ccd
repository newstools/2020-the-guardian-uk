Internazionale have confirmed the signing of the full-back Achraf Hakimi from Real Madrid, reportedly for an initial €40m (£36m) fee with €5m (£4.5m) in add-ons. “Achraf Hakimi is officially an Inter player,” an official club statement said. “The Moroccan, who was born in 1998, has joined the Nerazzurri on a permanent basis from Real Madrid and has signed a contract which will last until 30 June 2025.” Hakimi, a Moroccan international who plays predominantly as a right-back, has been on the books at Madrid since joining their youth setup at the age of eight. He recently completed a successful two-year loan spell at Borussia Dortmund, where he made 53 Bundesliga appearances. “The club wishes to thank Achraf for his many years of dedication, professionalism and exemplary conduct since he joined our academy in 2006,” a Real Madrid statement said. “The club wishes him all the very best in this new chapter.” The 21-year-old had signalled his intention to leave the Bernabéu permanently and is unlikely to be Antonio Conte’s last major signing of the summer, with the Brescia midfielder Sandro Tonali also a key target.
