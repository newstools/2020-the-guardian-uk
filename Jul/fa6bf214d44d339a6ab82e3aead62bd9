Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our yogurt maker was our best purchase during lockdown. I’d love to know what other readers would say was their best stay-at-home purchase, or any disasters to avoid. Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
