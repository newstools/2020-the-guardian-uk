When I was given my first BBC contract, for three months in the further education department, it felt as if I were selling my soul, with so many constraints on what one could do. But then I came across Tony Cash who, apart from wearing a really cool leather jacket, talked in what felt a totally free way, saying exactly what he thought in departmental meetings, while others weighed their words with caution. I felt inspired by Tony, whose presence convinced me it was possible to live in a challenging and intellectually honest fashion at the BBC, where I worked for the next three decades.Giles Oakley Tony Cash produced episodes of the BBC’s eclectic arts strand The Lively Arts, and in 1977 made the bold decision to take an intelligent look at a piece of popular culture by examining the appeal and impact of Doctor Who, then 14 years old. That year, The Lively Arts covered Samuel Beckett, Beethoven and Mozart: Tony’s film, Whose Doctor Who, laudably treated its subject matter just as seriously. He interviewed parents, medical professionals, a psychologist and young viewers about the appeal and impact of the show, and went behind-the-scenes with Doctor Who’s production team (an unfamiliar sight then). It was the first documentary about series, and just five months before his death I presented, for its BBC Blu-Ray release, a follow-up that re-examined Tony’s film. On board throughout our production, Tony was a game interviewee and participated in an on-screen reunion with the now grown-up schoolchildren whose appearance on Whose Doctor Who was an important part of their lives then and a time capsule for them now.Toby Hadoke
