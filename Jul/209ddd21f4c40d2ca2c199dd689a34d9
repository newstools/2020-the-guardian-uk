Your article (Lack of testing and PPE among key England Covid-19 mistakes, MPs told, 24 July) confirms that the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is political. This government has shown itself to be in part responsible for thousands of deaths, many of us becoming seriously ill, being in intensive care and suffering long-term and, in some cases, irreversible damage. In my case, and with many others, this has also had a direct effect on our capacity to work and earn, and has put enormous pressure on those closest to us. All this is without factoring in the knock-on effect of how this government’s handing of the pandemic has forced the NHS to postpone treatment for people with other illnesses. You have also documented how New Zealand approached the matter in a much better way, again confirming that this is a matter of political choices.Michael RosenLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
