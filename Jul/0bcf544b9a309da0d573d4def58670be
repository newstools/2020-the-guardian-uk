Tony Martin, a record-breaking long jumper for Michigan State, has been shot and killed at the age of 19. Martin shattered Michigan’s long jump record with a leap of 26ft 6in (8.07m) while still in high school. He made his debut for Michigan State in December and also competed in the 60m and 200m. Police in Saginaw, where Martin grew up, said he was shot and killed outside a gas station in the early hours of Sunday morning. They are now investigating his death as part of a double homicide. “He was an easy-going guy,” his high school coach DeEddie Sanders told the Detroit Free Press. “He always did his schoolwork, and he never missed school … He loved track. He was a good guy, never got in trouble.” We send our condolences to the family and friends on the passing of Tony Martin. pic.twitter.com/d4yuQNyc7h Michigan State’s track and field team confirmed Martin’s death on Twitter.
