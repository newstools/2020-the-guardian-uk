This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today our questions are set by the Bowes Museum, a collection of art, fashion and design, housed in a chateau in Barnard Castle, at the border of Yorkshire and County Durham. You can see art from the collection on Art UK here. Find out more on the Bowes Museum website.
