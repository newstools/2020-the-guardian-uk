This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Royal Scottish Academy of Art and Architecture, in Edinburgh. The RSA is the oldest surviving Scottish artist-run institution and holds a collection recognised as being of national significance to Scotland. It includes the best of the nation’s art and architecture direct from practitioners of the past 200 years and is particularly strong in its representation of practice through sketchbooks, equipment and artistic connections. You can see art from the RSA on Art UK here. Find out more on the RSA website, here.
