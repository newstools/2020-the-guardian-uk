The most famous Flat race in the calendar is in need of a new sponsor following the surprising news that Investec, the banking and wealth management firm that has supported the Classic since 2009, has ended its 11-year association with Epsom racecourse with six years still left to run on its current contract. The Racing Post reported on Thursday evening that Jockey Club Racecourses had agreed to end its latest deal with Investec, which was due to run until 2026, and seek a new main sponsor for the Derby, Oaks and Coronation Cup, the three Group One events run over the two-day Derby meeting in early June. Investec is reportedly “working to a new set of priorities and a new mix of marketing channels”, and said that it had been “proud to play a role in the Derby’s recent history”. This year’s Derby took place a month later than normal due to the coronavirus lockdown, and without the usual crowd of more than 100,000 spectators that regularly congregates on the Surrey downs to watch the world’s most famous Classic. The Oaks took place on the same afternoon, while the Coronation Cup was staged at Newmarket in early June. The unexpected news of Investec’s departure leaves three of British racing’s Classic events without a sponsor, as the St Leger at Doncaster is also unsponsored at present. Jockey Club Racecourses has some time to find a new supporter for its most famous Flat race as the next running is just over 10 months away, but in a deeply uncertain economic and social climate, it could be a very difficult task to find a sponsor to match the one it has lost. Investec’s decision to pull out of its Derby sponsorship came out of the blue and arrives at a time when racing continues to struggle with extreme financial pressures after an 11-week shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic, and amid the ongoing requirement to race behind closed doors. The sport has also failed to sign an extension to ITV’s exclusive four-year contract for terrestrial coverage, which runs out at the end of December. The Derby is one of the four “Crown Jewel” events, along with the Cheltenham Festival, the Grand National and Royal Ascot, included in the deal, but the line coming out of Jockey Club Racecourses on Friday morning is that Investec’s abrupt departure is not linked to the continuing uncertainty over the ITV deal. Instead, the suggestion is that Investec’s decision reflects a desire on the Jockey Club’s part to find a lead sponsor that is fully committed to the Derby now that Investec’s global marketing strategy has changed. That implies that Investec has paid up at least part of the outstanding contract to release itself from the sponsorship, as the firm’s decision to pull out has not come as part of a “break” clause in the deal. As for today’s racing, Al Rufaa (1.10) will take some stopping back on turf at Newmarket after a wide-margin success in a first-time hood at Kempton 11 days ago. John Gosden’s colt is bred to win Classics and showed a striking turn of foot to go clear last time out, while stopping the clock in a time that suggests he was full value for the margin of just under five lengths.

Richard Hannon’s colt was second in a strong time at Windsor 11 days ago behind an opponent who saved every possible inch of ground against the rail. This is his last chance to race off 87 before going up 5lb for that run and he should make it a winning one. Darain (2.50) is too short to back but is worth looking out for with an eye to the future, as he was the most expensive yearling sold at auction anywhere in the world in 2018 and looked like he might recoup at least a portion of his 3.5m guineas price tag when he bolted up on his belated debut at Newbury earlier this month. Grand Bazaar (3.55) also has an obvious chance on the same card, while Kentuckyconnection (1.50) and Le Chiffre (2.25) have big claims at Beverley.
