This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Hepworth Wakefield, the collection established in 1923 with a collecting policy to “nurture a public understanding of contemporary art and its relations to modern life”. Works were acquired by the up-and-coming artists of the day, including local heroes Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. Today the collection is celebrated for its holdings of 20th-century and contemporary art. You can see art from the Hepworth Wakefield on Art UK here. Find out more on its website here.
