One of the New South Wales communities badly affected by bushfires last summer is expected to cop the brunt of an intense weather event this week. Heavy rainfall, strong winds and dangerous surf are forecast for large parts of NSW in coming days. Between 80mm and 120mm of rainfall is forecast for Batemans Bay and Narooma on Monday, while Sydney and Wollongong could receive more than 35mm on Tuesday. People along the NSW coast, in the southeast and the Australian Capital Territory have been urged to prepare their properties and watch for updates and warnings, as the low-pressure system intensifies off the coast. “It is possible this rainfall could lead to flooding in some areas as the [severe weather] event progresses,” the Bureau of Meteorology said in a statement on Sunday. “People travelling for school holidays, especially those visiting unfamiliar areas, should pay particular attention to any warnings. “Strong or damaging winds will be a risk along parts of the coast, as will dangerous surf conditions.” The most intense falls are centred on several NSW south coast areas which were badly affected by bushfire in December and January. Heavy rainfall in February led to flash-flooding exacerbated by a lack of vegetation and numerous dead wildlife. While there is now more regrowth and communities are rebuilding, the SES said it was “still a matter of concern”. “We’re aware it’s been a pretty difficult year on the south coast,” SES spokeswoman Stephanie Heard told AAP on Sunday. “This is why we’re taking the opportunity to prepare these communities and making sure they’re getting their properties ready. Heard urged locals to heed emergency services’ advice to stay out of floodwater and never drive through flooded roads. “Don’t take the risk,” she said.
