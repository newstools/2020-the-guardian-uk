This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove. The Brighton Museums collection ranges from late 15th-century European woodcuts and old master paintings to modern British paintings and 20th-century abstract expressionist works. It contains nearly 1,500 oil paintings, 4,000 watercolours and drawings, and more than 10,000 prints. It also includes topographical material on the history of Brighton and Hove, and prized Chinese export watercolours and oil paintings.
