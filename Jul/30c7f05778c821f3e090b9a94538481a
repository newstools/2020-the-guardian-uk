Andrew Clements, in criticising the Proms’ virtual orchestra as “trivial”, is missing the point (Opening night of the virtual Proms – archive treasures and a trite mash-up, 17 July). By involving 350 professional orchestral musicians, recording themselves individually at home, Iain Farrington has provided them with some paid work. The result was a tribute to the skill and professionalism of all involved. We are lucky to have such musicians in this country and they deserve support and appreciation. Perhaps the decision to include more recent performances from the archive in this year’s programme rather than from the 1960s will also provide much-needed help to musicians facing uncertain futures.Wendy StaalBridport, Dorset • The Southbank Centre warns of 400 redundancies; Birmingham’s Town Hall and Symphony Hall are set to lose half their staff; the Wales Millennium Centre is discussing 250 redundancies. Who will be next – the Barbican in London? Manchester’s Bridgwater Hall? Sage Gateshead? Six internationally acclaimed orchestras are at risk if the Southbank Centre sinks. Meanwhile, more than 40% of orchestral musicians are claiming universal credit. Musicians’ organisations tell of emails saying “I have no money to buy food”. None of these are covered by Rishi Sunak’s schemes. None are the crown jewels that Oliver Dowden says will be saved. But to the communities they serve, they are the jewels that enrich lives.Ruth WindleFrome, Somerset • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
