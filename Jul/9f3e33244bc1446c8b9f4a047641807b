I was astonished to see, among the “mysterious” gadgets that the Science Museum is trying to identify (Report, 19 July), the Hobbies A1 Treadle Fretsaw of which my late dad made extensive use in the late 1940s. His party piece, then hanging on our and numerous relatives’ walls, was a wall plaque with a delicately cut out galleon, which he copied from the back of an old halfpenny. Hobbies Weekly was very popular, and he bought his fretsaw from their Manchester shop. Brian Smith Goostrey, Cheshire • Adrian Chiles (The secret of my hard-won mindfulness? A bargain bag of beauty, 15 July) fondly remembers a trip to the pub in his “friend Lee’s Ford Escort XR2”. The XR2 was the slightly souped-up Ford Fiesta. The Escort equivalent was the XR3. Blame it on the beer.

Russell T Davies Manchester • In order for the prime minister’s prediction to come true (Boris Johnson unveils plan to return England ‘to normality’ by Christmas, 17 July), maybe we should now all be washing our hands to the tune of Jingle Bells? Kate Burgess Bicker, Lincolnshire • Thanks, Pete Nuttall (Letters, 19 July). After 48 hours I’d finally rid myself of the Peter Sarstedt earworm triggered by the death of Zizi Jeanmaire, and now you’ve gone and started it off all over again.
