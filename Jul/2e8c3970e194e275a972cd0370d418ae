There may soon be travel corridors agreed with countries in Europe allowing UK citizens to visit the likes of Spain, Italy and France without the need to quarantine for 14 days on return. Now the tantalising possibility of being able to discover new places is before us, we’d love to hear your experiences of “hidden” Europe. We’d like you to avoid cities, restaurants and bars for obvious reasons, but want to hear about quiet, unsung areas and beautiful walks, historic sites and cycle routes away from the busier areas. Beaches off the beaten track which you can only reach by walking would also be welcome. The best tip of the week, will be chosen by travel expert Tom Hall. The winner will receive a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. Please keep your tip to about 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
