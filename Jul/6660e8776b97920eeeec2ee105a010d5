Stiegl Radler is essentially the beer version of Lilt, with similar tropical notes. It’s widely available nationwide (ask the local off-licence to order some in, if need be) and only 2% abv, which makes it a brilliant summer option (if you can’t find any, though, try Schofferhofer’s 2.5% grapefruit beer, which you can get at Morrisons and online – try Hop Burns & Black). Serves 1 50ml tequila blanco – we use El Jimador25ml agave syrup1 squeeze fresh lemon or lime juiceStiegl Radler grapefruit beer, to top1 slice or wedge pink grapefruit, to garnish Fill a well-chilled 500ml tankard with ice, add the tequila, agave syrup and lemon or lime juice, top with the beer and stir gently to combine.
