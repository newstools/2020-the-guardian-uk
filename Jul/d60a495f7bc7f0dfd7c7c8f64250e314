Paul Weller has joined John Lennon and Paul McCartney as the only artists to top the UK album chart in five consecutive decades. Weller said he was “very proud” to see his album On Sunset reach No 1. His previous chart-toppers include one with the Jam (The Gift, 1982) and one with the Style Council (Our Favourite Shop, 1985), plus five solo albums: On Sunset plus Stanley Road (1995), Illumination (2002), 22 Dreams (2008) and Sonik Kicks (2012). At No 2 is Pop Smoke’s album Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon – the New York rapper was killed in a home invasion in February, with five people now arrested over the shooting. His mixtape Meet the Woo 2 re-entered at 32, and his single The Woo reached No 9 in the singles chart with two other tracks also reaching the Top 40. At No 3 in the album chart is another new entry, Cinema Paradiso, a collection of movie soundtrack songs performed by soprano Katherine Jenkins. Jason Derulo and producer Jawsh 685 spend a second week at the top of the singles chart with Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat), after having become a viral hit on TikTok and earning 7.2m streams in the last week.
