But we do talk every day. [Suddenly worried] Oh, gee. OK. I’ll do the best I can. I don’t watch a lot of TV, but I’ll give it a shot. To be honest, the last show I watched was Muppets Now. I’ve got to watch them and make sure they’re all looking good and ready to go for Disney+. We’ve got great guest stars this season.

Lost, that’s kind of a sad ending, right? Muppets Now is available from 31 July on Disney+
