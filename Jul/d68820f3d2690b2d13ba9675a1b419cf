I’d like to put in a word for children who unwittingly appear in their parents’ TV interviews (‘Mummy, what’s his name?’: expert’s daughter invades BBC interview, 1 July). Why do you describe this as “invading” the interview? They are in their own homes. I would say the programmes are invading their space.Fiona CollinsCarrog, Sir Ddinbych • Re footballers being married to hairdressers (Letters, 30 June), no one needs to be a hairdresser to cut men’s hair. I have cut my husband’s hair for the past 50 years (yes, he still has hair at 86). My sister has cut her husband’s hair during lockdown and two of our grandsons have cut each other’s hair with excellent results. Will barbers go out of business?Liz PearceTimsbury, Bath • Both Sue Morgan and Gill Coleman are right (Mixed reactions to crowds at Bournemouth, Letters, 30 June). Some people do need to go to the beach, but surely not all to the same beach. Britain’s coastline, including islands, is 31,368km, so there is room for over 15 million of us to stand on the shoreline 2 metres apart.Colin PearsonTilehurst, Reading • Good to hear Ian Grieve will be back on the canal (Letters, 30 June). Three or four consecutive promotions for Stockport County and he should be a happy man.Michael Cunningham Wolverhampton • “Tall objectionable feminist seeks man to object to” remains my all-time favourite Guardian Soulmates ad. I never had the courage to volunteer as an objectee.Michael WoodgateBedminster, Bristol
