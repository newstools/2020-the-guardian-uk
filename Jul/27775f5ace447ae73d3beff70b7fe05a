Indonesia’s agriculture minister has been condemned by health experts for claiming that a necklace made from eucalyptus can help prevent transmission of Covid-19. Syahrul Yasin Limpo had said the necklace, if worn for 30 minutes, could help destroy much of the coronavirus. It had been developed by the agriculture ministry, along with roll-ons and a mini-inhaler, and would be mass-produced in August, he said. Facing criticism from infectious disease specialists, the ministry has since backtracked and said the products will not be advertised as having the ability to prevent or cure Covid-19. Instead, they will be classified as herbal products, the ministry’s research and development department head, Fadjry Djufry, said on Monday. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, politicians, religious leaders and other authority figures across the world have touted quack cures, undermining efforts by health professionals to provide clear information to the public. The unsubstantiated claims regarding the necklace drew criticism from health experts in Indonesia, including Herawati Sudoyo, the deputy director of the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology. “We know that the world has not yet found a cure for the disease. I think it would be wise for us not to spread further claims to a panicked society,” she told the Jakarta Post. The Indonesian health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, however, has continued to defend the necklace. People who wear one may feel more confident, he told Kompas TV, and this could boost their immune systems. He previously said prayers had helped prevent the spread of coronavirus in the country. While many south-east Asian countries have managed to contain Covid-19 transmission, Indonesia is facing an escalating outbreak. As of Monday, the country has recorded 64,958 cases and 3,241 fatalities, though health figures say this is likely an underestimate.
