The Major League Baseball side Cleveland are to review the use of their team moniker the Indians in light of recent anti-racism protests. Cleveland replaced their logo two years ago, swapping a cartoon of a Native American named Chief Wahoo with a letter C. The review was announced hours after the NFL side Washington said they would look at their Redskins moniker amid outrage following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.A statement said: “The recent social unrest in our community and our country has only underscored the need for us to keep improving as an organisation on issues of social justice. With that in mind, we are committed to engaging our community and appropriate stakeholders to determine the best path forward with regard to our team name.”Washington’s move follows increasing calls for change, including from one of the team’s main sponsors, FedEx. A statement said: “The team will undergo a thorough review of the team’s name. This review formalises the initial discussions the team has been having with the league in recent weeks.”The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in a statement the league is supportive of the team’s move.
