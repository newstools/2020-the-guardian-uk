This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Royal Academy of Arts. The RA Collection began with the foundation of the Royal Academy over 250 years ago, comprising works of art to help teach and inspire students at the RA Schools, and diploma works given by the artists themselves upon election to the Academy. The collection ranges across historic and contemporary art, including paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photography, silver and furniture, as well as the library and archive. You can see art from the Royal Academy of Arts on Art UK here. Find out more on the collection’s website here.
