Before moving on to film, Earl Cameron did much to help establish black theatre in Britain. He was a member of the 1944 Negro Repertory theatre, probably the first black-led British theatre company, and later of the Negro Theatre Workshop and the Pan African Players, whose production of Obi Egbunaâ€™s play Wind Versus Polygamy having been turned down by the Commonwealth Arts Festival, was seen in Dakar, Senegal, at the first World Festival of Negro Arts (1966). The play, with Cameron still in the cast, was subsequently broadcast on BBC TV as well as on BBC radio.
