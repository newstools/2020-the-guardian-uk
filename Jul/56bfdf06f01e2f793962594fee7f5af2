Nemanja Matic has signed a new contract that will keep him at Manchester United until 2023. The deal follows a noticeable return to form from the 31-year-old Matic, his midfield performances impressing during the current 16-match unbeaten run. “I am very happy that I will continue to be part of this great club,” he said. “As a player I still have a lot more to give and achieve, and to do that with Manchester United will be a huge honour. “This is a really exciting team to be part of, we have a good balance of youth and experience and there is great camaraderie amongst the group. This is a key part of the season and we are playing well. We will continue to fight to finish on a high and make our amazing supporters proud.” The manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, pointed to the player’s seniority when welcoming the news. “I am delighted that Nemanja has signed a new contract – I know his experience, professionalism and leadership will be invaluable to this young talented group,” he said. “We have great strength in midfield and Nemanja’s attributes are a key part of that. Nemanja has been here for three seasons now and really understands the values of playing for Manchester United. He remains hugely ambitious and determined, which will be vital as we look to achieve our aims over the coming years.” Matic joined from Chelsea in summer 2017 and has made 114 appearances for United. The length of the deal offered – three years – for a player who turns 32 on 1 August is a rarity, United’s policy often being to offer single-season extensions for those over 30.
