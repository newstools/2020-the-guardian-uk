The daughter of a British man who reportedly fell to his death from a seventh-storey hotel balcony in a plunge that also killed a local man below has paid tribute to her father. Antonio Gonzalez was with his wife at a five-star hotel in the Spanish resort of Marbella when Tony Holmes, 49, landed on him, according to reports. Holmes’s daughter Chantelle, from Newcastle, paid tribute to her father on social media, saying how much she loved him. She wrote: “Don’t even no (sic) how I’m going to cope with out you dad, a hope you no how much I’ve always loved you and all do anything for you. Wish it was all a bad dream. “I’m a mess without you a love you so much it’s killing me that I’m never going to see you again look at your beautiful smile on every pic.” According to reports, 43-year-old Gonzalez, who owned a gym and supported local charities, was with his wife and friends when Holmes fell from the balcony of the Gran Meliá Don Pepe hotel at about 2am on Saturday. Holmes’s mother Audrery, 65, of South Shields in Tyne and Wear, said she and his father - also called Tony - were “heartbroken”. She added: “I have so many questions I want answered. We don’t want to talk about it to anybody at the moment because we’ve got no answers, we’ve only got questions.” Tributes were also paid to Gonzalez. His friend Iván, who works as a kickboxer in a different gym, said: “Sometimes life takes people who deserve it the least, for the dumbest, most unrealistic circumstance. “My condolences, hug huge and all the strength for his family, a great man, close with his clients, family. RIP friend. Marbella will not forget you.”
