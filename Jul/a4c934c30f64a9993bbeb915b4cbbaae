Manu Tuilagi is set to keep his England career alive with a move to Sale after his acrimonious departure from Leicester. The 29-year-old’s exit from Welford Road was confirmed on Friday and he is expected to sign for Sale this coming week, the Observer understands. Tuilagi had been linked with a lucrative move abroad after refusing to accept a cut to his £500,000-a-year salary but he was determined to stay in the Premiership and remain eligible for England. The Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, denied talks with the centre this past week but did confirm the Sharks were one of few clubs that had room for Tuilagi within the salary cap. As reported by the Guardian, Tuilagi would have a straightforward claim for compensation against Leicester if the deal with Sale proves to be less than his previous contract at the Tigers. There had been suggestions Tuilagi may agree a short-term deal with a Premiership club for the remainder of the season before heading overseas but the Telegraph has reported his Sale contract is set to extend beyond the rest of the current campaign. Sale are second in the table, five points behind Exeter, with Tuilagi set to bolster their title push. The move would set up a mouthwatering centre partnership with the South African Rohan Janse van Rensburg, while Tuilagi is also set to team up with his England colleague Tom Curry and the Springbok World Cup winners Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager.
