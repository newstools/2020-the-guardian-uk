England’s white-ball cricketers look set to play in a delayed Indian Premier League this winter following confirmation that the T20 World Cup has been pushed back by 12 months. Eoin Morgan’s team had been looking to complete a double this year by following last year’s 50-over World Cup triumph at home with an assault on its short-form equivalent in Australia this October and November. But in a move that has been widely expected since the Covid-19 pandemic’s outbreak, the International Cricket Council has announced that it has now moved to October and November 2021, with another edition then following a year later. The global governing body has yet to state which countries will stage the two tournaments. India, who were originally down to host the 2021 tournament, may have to wait for Australia to go first but have been confirmed as hosts for the 2023 50-over men’s World Cup in October and November that year. Preparations for the 50-over women’s World Cup in New Zealand next February are continuing but the ICC admitted it will continue to evaluate the situation despite the country’s relative success in tackling the pandemic. The reshuffle of men’s events now presents a chance for India to finally stage this year’s IPL following its postponement in April, with the United Arab Emirates tipped as a possible alternative host from September. Morgan, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer are among the 13 England players with contracts at the eight IPL franchises. According to a report in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph they may travel to the UAE on the same plane as Australia’s one-day team following their proposed tour of England in early September.
