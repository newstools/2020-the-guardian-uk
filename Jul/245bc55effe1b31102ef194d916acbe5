Like many readers, I became familiar with Paulette Wilson’s part in the Windrush scandal as a result of Amelia Gentleman’s carefully crafted pieces over the past couple of years, describing a dignified and determined lady (Without Paulette Wilson, Windrush might have remained hidden, 24 July). Nothing prepared us for the reality that the “hostile environment” policy translates into hateful letters from officials declaring that “your life in the UK will become increasingly more difficult”. Officials, who may claim that they were just following orders, should hang their heads in shame at being associated with such appalling actions. The public has been ill-served by all those who devised and implemented this policy. No amount of half-hearted apologies from assorted politicians changes the fact that people appear to be dying at a faster rate than the Home Office settles lawful claims for compensation.Les BrightExeter, Devon • Simply: Paulette Wilson should have a statue.Rod WarringtonUpton-by-Chester, Cheshire
