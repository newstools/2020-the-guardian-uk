Liverpool will receive the Premier League trophy on a podium built on the Kop as part of plans to encourage fans to stay at home for the title celebration. Jürgen Klopp’s champions will be presented with the trophy, the club’s first of the Premier League era, after next Wednesday’s final home game of the season against Chelsea. Liverpool’s players, led by the captain Jordan Henderson, have been involved in planning the trophy ceremony and will receive their medals and the coveted silverware on a podium constructed on the Kop. Seats have been removed to create space for the temporary construction, and the club legend Kenny Dalglish will be involved in a presentation that will adhere to Covid-19 health and safety protocols. Supporters’ banners will surround the podium and will be fireproofed to avoid any incidents with pyrotechnics. Liverpool players embraced the idea of a presentation on the Kop as a way of acknowledging fans while football continues to behind closed doors. The club is also promoting an #LFCatHome campaign for the Chelsea game and the ceremony is part of efforts to encourage fans to watch at home instead of gathering outside Anfield, as occurred the night the title was won.
