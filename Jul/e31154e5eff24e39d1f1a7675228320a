The US rapper known as Lil Marlo has died, his record label said Sunday. Quality Control Music announced the death of Rudolph “Marlo” Johnson in a social media post, saying he will be remembered as “a man of great talent who feared nothing.” The Atlanta police department issued a statement saying a man named Rudolph Johnson was killed late Saturday in what investigators believe was a targeted shooting. Officers responded to a single-car wreck on Interstate 285 in Atlanta at about 11.30pm Saturday night and found the driver, later identified as Johnson, dead inside his vehicle, the statement said. “At this time, investigators believe the victim was the intended target of the gunfire and they are working to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting,” the statement said. Police identified Johnson as 30 years old, while the social media post from Quality Control Music says he was born in 1993. Representatives for the record label did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday. Johnson joined Quality Control Music in 2017 alongside rappers Migos, Lil Yachty, and his collaborator Lil Baby. Lil Yachty posted a tribute to Johnson on Instagram on Sunday, saying, “We just did a song [at] 4 this morning smh rip brother.”
