Like Nicholas Worsley (Letters, 8 July), I also wear hearing aids, so masks that attach behind the ears are useless as they keep pulling them off.

Gay Viinikka Worthing, West Sussex • The reusable cotton masks I bought (with profits going to the NHS) have a channel where a pipe cleaner can be inserted to fit the bridge of the nose.
