As current and former policymakers who have dedicated their careers to promoting peace and security worldwide, we urge all UN member states to reinforce their overwhelming vote of support from last December for the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) by now providing the funding the agency desperately needs. Without consistent, reliable funding UNRWA will not be able to fulfil its UN-mandated mission to protect and assist a vulnerable population of 5.6 million Palestinian refugees until there is a just and lasting solution to their plight. In a region rife with conflicts, and now battling the health and socioeconomic impacts of Covid-19, UNRWA stands as a vital source of regional stability. The last three months have again demonstrated there is no alternative to UNRWA that can respond to emergencies while continuing to invest in human beings. UNRWA has been recognised as a major contributor in the containment of the Covid-19 virus, particularly in preventing its spread through densely populated Palestinian refugee camps in the region. Drawing on its long experience in conflict zones, UNRWA quickly adapted the provision of its services in concert with WHO recommendations and host-country requirements. As a result, medical, hygiene and sanitation, isolation and general support services have gone largely uninterrupted. UNRWA provides quality education in a region where instability and conflicts are widespread. UNRWA schools have contributed to the education of some 2.5 million girls and boys and have instilled the principles of tolerance and human rights in hundreds of thousands of young minds. The recent talk of unilateral annexation of parts of the West Bank by Israel and the announcement by the US administration of the “Peace to Prosperity” plan raise concerns about departing from an internationally agreed process aimed at achieving a lasting settlement, including for Palestinian refugees, based upon United Nations resolutions.
