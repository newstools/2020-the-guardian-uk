David Silva’s 309th and final Premier League appearance for Manchester City was a canter of a victory over already relegated Norwich. It means the champions of the past two seasons finish on 81 points, 18 behind Liverpool, with 102 goals as they bid farewell to Silva – from domestic competition, at least – the key player in the club’s success in the past decade. On 84 minutes Silva was replaced by Bernardo Silva to supremely deserved applause from managers, substitutes, staff and the media, the 34-year-old shaking every hand he could. “It was the smallest standing ovation of all time but he will come back to receive the ovation he deserves – I have the feeling that the fans want to do it,” said Guardiola, referencing the empty stadium. “The team wanted to say thank you for what he’s done for this club for 10 years.” Silva also received a congratulatory phone call from the City chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak. On a pleasing day for City Kevin De Bruyne was in scintillating form, scoring twice and, in providing a 20th assist to create Raheem Sterling’s third goal, he equalled Thierry Henry’s Premier League record. And, in keeping a 16th clean sheet, Ederson also claimed the Golden Gloves award. De Bruyne said: “It is nice to have [the record] and it is nice to have it with Thierry.” Silva’s silken touch was evident early on as he floated around the Norwich area. Yet City had a scare when Onel Hernández beat Ederson in the eighth minute before VAR ruled it offside. This woke City and they took the lead three minutes later. Sterling swapped passes with the imperious De Bruyne, crossed, and after a scramble Gabriel Jesus forced home from close range. Daniel Farke’s selection of two goalkeepers on an eight-man substitutes bench hardly suggested that a run of 10 consecutive losses could be arrested and so it proved. Norwich’s hope lay on the counterattack as when Teemu Pukki raced beyond City’s defence from a Lukas Rupp pass. Yet he disappointed by hitting the ball straight at Ederson, then Todd Cantwell could not chip the rebound into an empty net. Thank you @premierleague ! It’s been a hell of a ride 😍💙 pic.twitter.com/lxx6QWVfPG De Bruyne showed him how with a sublime strike as half-time neared. Fancy footwork was followed by a blistering 18-yard finish, from an angle, that allowed Tim Krul no chance. For the second half Guardiola introduced Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gündogan for Eric García, Phil Foden and Rodri, respectively. Silva went close to adding to his 93 Premier League assists with a low ball across Krul that begged to be finished. Then, it was nearly goal No 61 in the competition, but the visiting goalkeeper saved sharply. Then, after Sterling’s strike, Mahrez added the fourth and De Bruyne hit a late second and City’s fifth. Farke has to rebuild in the close season. “We have to be ready for the challenge and demands of the Championship,” he said. Now City focus on Real Madrid in the Champions League last-16 second leg, which will be played at the Etihad Stadium despite the fortnight quarantine imposed on those returning to the UK due to Spain’s coronavirus spike.
