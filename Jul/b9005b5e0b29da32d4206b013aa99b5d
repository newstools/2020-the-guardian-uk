Vinca Petersen took this picture of her friend Paula as the sun came up after an all-night rave in Italy in 1997. By then Petersen had been on the road for four years with some of the “sound-system tribes” who had taken their free party culture across Europe after the 1994 Criminal Justice bill had outlawed raves in the UK. The picture comes from a reissue of Petersen’s book No System, which is her insider’s view of that hedonistic, nomadic life in the years leading up to the millennium.Petersen gave up her life on the road in 2004, when her son was born. In some senses those photographs look like historical documents to her now, but she still feels their familiarity and excitement. “When you live that sort of life, as I did for the whole of my 20s, there is a mentality you are left with,” she says. She called that mentality, in a recent exhibition, A Life of Subversive Joy, and sees her pictures as part of the family album of that universal possibility. Her images often celebrated these private moments of connection, with people and with nature. “The highs were much more a consistent feeling of freedom than any sort of peak moments,” she says. “Obviously it is fantastic being in a huge crowd dancing the night away, but for me it was the whole life, whether it was parking up around the lake or turning up in a new city and meeting other like-minded people.” She could still probably arrive in any city in Europe and find someone to stay with who was part of that time, she says, “but I do rather like a nice comfy bed these days”. Paula is back settled and working in the UK now too. Petersen likes the idea that in the picture the night before is still going on. “It’s sunrise,” she says, “but it’s not a new day.” The second edition of No System will be published on 10 August, priced £35.
