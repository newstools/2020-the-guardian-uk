As one closely involved in the implementation of the Youth Training Scheme, I beg to differ from the view that “the YTS was soul-destroying, and a complete disgrace” (Letters, 8 July). Certainly, the YTS in delivery was by no means perfect, but as a design framework for young people entering the labour market it was pretty good and attempted to do something never before tried in the UK – namely, provide proper training and work experience for a whole cohort of school leavers. Its components included planned work experience, on- and off-the-job training and education, the development of a range of core skills to facilitate adaptability in a rapidly changing labour market, and a record of achievement. A brave attempt to provide a structured programme of learning for young school leavers? Yes. A “complete disgrace”? Certainly not. A curate’s egg? Possibly, given the scope of its ambition. Better than the current offer? Certainly.Roy BoffyProject leader, Midlands region, ESF/YTS core skills project, 1982-85 • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
