If you can never step into the same river twice, it follows that you won’t walk along the same bank twice. Which is probably why riverside strolls are so alluring: the waters changing with the weather, time of day and season – rushing or babbling, smooth or sparkling. This week we’d love to hear about your favourite river walk in the UK, be it through a historic city, along a dramatic valley or just in idyllic countryside. Try to be as specific as you can, with starting point, length and type of terrain, plus a website if there is one, and keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
