Mohamed Salah has said he wants to remain at Liverpool for a long time and believes the team have developed a perfect understanding. The forward, who signed a new five-year deal in 2018, is the club’s top scorer this season with 17 Premier League goals, helping Liverpool to secure a 19th top-flight title with seven games to spare. Jürgen Klopp said on Saturday his aim was to keep his squad together and Salah’s words will be music to the manager’s ears. “I’m very happy … I can’t describe my feelings after we won the league after 30 years,” Salah told BeIN Sport. “I can see people’s joy and this is so important for all of us. I enjoy the atmosphere here ... I love this place and I hope to stay for a long time. The atmosphere here is different to any other place. “We have adapted well as a team and our understanding is perfect. If this continues, we can achieve more. It’s difficult to maintain our current level, but it’s not impossible.” Salah hailed the impact of the captain, Jordan Henderson, and said he would pick the midfielder as the best player in the league this season. “Maybe I’ll choose Henderson because he’s the captain and he’s been here for about eight-nine years. He had a difficult time in the beginning and he was heavily criticised. He, as a captain, is loved by all of us and he tries to help all players and helps youth players to adapt.” Liverpool visit second-placed Manchester City in the league on Thursday.
