Johanna Konta took an important step forward in her preparation for the return of professional tennis as she recovered from a set and two breaks down to defeat Katie Boulter 2-6, 7-6 (5), 10-6, securing her first win at the Battle of the Brits in Roehampton. Elsewhere, the men’s British No 1, Dan Evans, defeated Kyle Edmund 6-4 6-4. Having not competed since early March, Konta has found herself in an awkward position this week as she brushes off four months of rust against opponents who have been grooved by weeks of domestic competition. As in the defeat by the world No 289 Jodie Burrage, the difference in match sharpness was clear early on as Konta struggled badly behind her serve until she was 6-2, 3-0 down. Just as Boulter seemed to be running away with the match, Konta reeled off five consecutive games before eking out the second set tiebreak. By the end Konta looked like a completely different player, like herself, commanding the baseline as she secured an encouraging win. “It’s going to take time,” said Konta. “I think more than anything, I think I just gave myself a chance to start playing better. I thought in both matches I was in a good mindset, but especially today I just kept giving myself the best chance for my level to get better.” The future remains uncertain. On Monday night, two ATP Challenger events scheduled for late August in Florida were cancelled. On Tuesday, America’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, declared himself “concerned” about the rising number of coronavirus cases in Kentucky, where the WTA’s Top Seed Open in Lexington begins on 10 August with Konta and Serena Williams in the field. Additionally, the ATP side of the Western & Southern Open next month has significantly decreased its prize money and will award a greater percentage of its pot to the earlier rounds. Konta, a member of the WTA council, said the WTA had not yet made its decision but she underlined the need to compensate players fairly both in these unique circumstances and generally in the future. ‘You’re always going to be looking for the balance of rewarding the players who do well but equally making sure that the best players in the world who are in the first round are still able to make a good living and a living that is appropriate to the level of commitment and work that goes into becoming a top player,” she said.
