1) Arsenal meet Chelsea in the small matter of the FA Cup final on Saturday. They contested the final in 2002, of course, when ‘Ooh-aah’ Ray Parlour scored that screamer. Can you remember who scored the goals in the 2017 final, when the Gunners defeated Chelsea 2-1? Neither can we, so here are the highlights. To level things up a touch, here’s a stonking Peter Osgood volley for Chelsea in a 1973 quarter-final. 2) A very happy birthday to former dual-code flyer Jason Robinson. Give him a rugby ball and a bit of space and this is what happens. Here he is giving Chris Latham a terrible time for the British & Irish Lions at the Gabba in 2001. Then there was Robinson’s pivotal try in the 2003 final against Australia, arguably featuring the best try celebration in history. And here’s a five-minute compilation of fine Six Nations finishes for England, just for good measure. 3) It is also Jürgen Klinsmann’s birthday. Fancy watching his top 10 goals for Internazionale? You certainly do. Admittedly, his top five Bundesliga goals are probably better, including a couple of Mark Hughes-style scissor-kicks. And here’s a nostalgic look back at the German’s career from the Bundesliga. Klinsmann arrived at Tottenham via Monaco with a reputation as a diver, so naturally celebrated his first Premier League goal for the club, a trademark bullet header against Sheffield Wednesday, with a dive. 4) With the series against West Indies now completed, Pakistan will be the next opponents to enter England’s bio-secure bubble. Head back in time to Lord’s in 2001, when Nasser Hussain’s England trounced Pakistan by an innings. Here we have a classic Waqar Younis stump-clattering compilation. Day five from Edgbaston in 2016, when England mounted a fine comeback, is worth revisiting here. And here is Jos Buttler smashing it to all parts in a pre-World Cup ODI last summer. 5) The story of Annika Sorenstam’s 1995 US Women’s Open triumph. 6) How many years of bad luck do you get for smashing the Russian Cup? It appears that Zenit St Petersburg captain Branislav Ivanovic is about to find out, after his team’s final triumph against Khimki on Saturday. «Зенит» так радовался победе в Кубке, что разбил трофей 😱Теперь у чаши не хватает крышки 🏆https://t.co/o6R5LmUk18 pic.twitter.com/je35mVlNpa The former Chelsea man isn’t the first high-profile defender to suffer an embarrassing moment with a trophy. Back in 2011, Real Madrid’s panto villain Sergio Ramos dropped the Copa del Rey under the wheels of their open-top bus. There was also that time Marco Materazzi put a hat on the World Cup after the final in 2006, much to the chagrin of the then-Fifa top dog Lennart Johansson, who was clearly so irritated he stopped the footage from appearing on YouTube, so here is a photo instead. 1) Incredible ping pong. 2) A big leap. 3) More leaping. 4) Endless penalties. 5) Rogaining … Spotters’ badges: VsBain67, denothemeno, whobroughtoranges.
