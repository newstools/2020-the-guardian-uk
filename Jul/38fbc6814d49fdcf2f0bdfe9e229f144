Last week, David Mitchell wrote about restaurant no-shows – ‘People I can really sink my teeth into’. Here’s how you responded online: I know of people who routinely book two or three restaurants for a night out and only decide that evening where they want to go. One of the places gets lucky, the others get screwed. I understand restaurateurs’ concerns about requiring diners to leave a deposit, but I’d have no issue with this. And I suspect most considerate and genuine customers wouldn’t either. Peasywease I went out for my first meal last night with my girlfriend. We were supposed to be four people, but the other couple had to bail. I contacted the restaurant immediately and informed them. On arrival, the restaurant was empty. We enjoyed a fantastic meal. Speaking with the chef/owner on payment, he told me all of the tables had been booked and not one diner had called to cancel. He, as an independent trader, was on course to lose over £700 last night, as all of the tables were socially distanced. Selfish, inconsiderate and wholly out of order. JAYJ1111 Why not make people pay in advance? You wouldn’t expect to reserve a seat for a football game, theatre show or a flight without paying. SudanSteve If the restaurant has the no-show’s phone number, can they not phone it back at, say, 1.30am and ask if they can stand down the kitchen staff yet or should they hang on? JohnnyASP Like airlines, restaurants could offer a discounted price to those who book in advance, non-returnable in cases of no-show. confundido
