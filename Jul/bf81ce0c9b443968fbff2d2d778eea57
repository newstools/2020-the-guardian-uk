Footballing legend Jack Charlton died last week aged 85, leaving behind memories of a glittering playing career for both England, with whom he won the World Cup in 1966, and Leeds United. He played for the Yorkshire club 773 times – a club record – and enjoyed two spells in the top flight, the latter of which saw Leeds become a dominant domestic force under manager Don Revie. A tough-tackling centre-back, Charlton marshalled their defence as Leeds won the League Cup in 1968, the league title in 1969 and the FA Cup in 1972. He and his teammates also recorded the now famous “Leeds, Leeds, Leeds” song in the lead up to the 1972 cup final. Originally a B-side, the anthem is still proudly sung at Elland Road as the club march closer and closer to a return to the Premier League. Marching on togetherWe’re gonna see you winWe are so proudWe shout it out loudWe love you Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!
