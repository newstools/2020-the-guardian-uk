Pep Guardiola has said the yellow ribbon he was fined for wearing on the touchline showed support for a humanitarian cause that has parallels with the Black Lives Matter movement. In March 2018 the Manchester City manager was fined £20,000 by the Football Association for “wearing a political message” – displaying the ribbon – during an FA Cup tie at Wigan. He explained then this was to honour people imprisoned after calling for a vote over Catalonian independence from Spain. Players and officials have taken a knee, in solidarity with BLM, before Premier League and FA Cup matches since football’s restart. Guardiola was asked whether he was confused regarding what is considered political by the sport’s authorities. “It is a question for the Premier League and for the people who ban me,” he said. “I think all the humanitarian causes must be defended and my yellow ribbon was for this; for the political prisoners who are still in jail for asking people to vote. “So I am not allowed to wear the yellow ribbon [during games] but all the time I bring and use the yellow ribbon [away from the pitch]. And now it is like for the Black Lives Matter: all causes to make our society better. I think every human being has to try and be there [being supportive].” City host Liverpool on Thursday, Jürgen Klopp’s team arriving having last week dethroned Guardiola’s side as champions. The City manager said his players had to show again how good they are. “We are incredibly satisfied [generally] with what we are doing, but for athletes it is never enough. Past is past. This is a new chapter in our lives and we have to live it. The people will say we don’t have to show anything. I am completely the opposite. Every time you have to do it again.”
