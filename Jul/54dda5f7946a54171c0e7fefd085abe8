While she begrudgingly refers to her trippy, kaleidoscopic musical melange as “funky soul pop”, 24-year-old California musician Remi Wolf isn’t a huge fan of genres. “I don’t believe in labels like that, though, because they literally don’t make sense any more,” she told i-D earlier this year. “Everything is soup.” Pinpointing all the references on last month’s heady second EP I’m Allergic to Dogs! (the follow-up to 2019’s debut, You’re a Dog!) would be nigh-on impossible anyway. Lyrically inspired by failed relationships, mental health struggles and, on the excellent Woo!, feeling everything at once, it zigzags between peak-era Prince, early MIA and the cosmic genre-hopping of recent collaborators Little Dragon. Wolf’s thirst for musical eccentrics took a while to be sated, however. Having grown up bored in the suburbs of California, she moved to Los Angeles when she was 17. There, she studied at USC Thornton School of Music, where she swapped a teenage love of John Mayer for more psychedelic-tinged artists such as Anderson .Paak and Kali Uchis who, as she told DIY, “made living life a little more colourful. I want the feeling they gave me to come through when people listen to my music.” It seems like a pretty safe bet. Streaked in neon, Wolf’s songs are anchored by their gloriously lurid lo-fi videos, created in lockdown with artist Agusta Yr. Featuring multiple Wolfs body-popping around bubblegum worlds inspired by Oompa Loompas and retro video games, they feel like a portal to pure escapism. I’m Allergic to Dogs! is out now on EMI Records/Island Records
