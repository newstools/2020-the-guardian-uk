The season of DIY haircuts is expected to come to an end. Hairdressers and barbers in England have been given the green light by the government to reopen their doors on 4 July, with some salons planing to open at midnight to clear a backlog of bookings. But before you have your hair styled back, we’d like to see photos of your lockdown locks pre-haircut, and ones fresh from the salon next week. We’d also like to know how you managed during lockdown. Did anyone help you keep your hair under control over the past three months? How successful or disastrous was the experience? If you’re planning a haircut on – or close to – 4 July, we’d like to hear from you. You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. We will be in contact with you before we publish – and to get a photo of your new do – so please leave contact details. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
