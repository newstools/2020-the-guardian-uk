Io Cammino in Italia (I Walk in Italy) is a campaign by walkers, guides, tour operators and hospitality providers, set up amid the coronavirus pandemic to work with local authorities to promote “slow tourism” on the country’s long-distance trails. The aim is to help rural economies hit by months of lockdown. “In just a few days our lives changed,” says leading member Gianluigi Bettin, a guidebook writer and sustainable-tourism expert. “We became suddenly aware of our vulnerability. Now, even if our bodies are healthy, we can see that our society is not, and it’s not all down to Covid-19. Many of us see the chance, even the need, to reassess our lifestyle and values. And one simple way to do this is to walk more.” The network covers almost 70 trails (from four-stage walks of around 60km to one of 1,006km) and most are now well-organised with waymarking, GPS and accommodation listings. Websites are mostly in Italian, but the group’s Facebook page can be used to post questions in English. Here are 10 rewarding routes – all waymarked – with standout places to stay and eat along the way. Various routes across the island, 1,500kmThe Santu Jacu network – originally used by pilgrims heading to the north-west of the island to cross to Spain for Santiago de Compostela – takes in Sardinia’s wild interior and varied coast but also has historic and cultural interest, with bronze age nuraghe, Phoenician, Greek and Roman ruins, and Romanesque churches. A demanding stretch crosses the limestone massif of the Supramonte, with caves, ravines and bandit history; a southern section from Cagliari offers sweeping coastal views.

It’s also probably its oldest: some stretches date from Etruscan times, and it was already called the Way of the Gods in Roman times. This is not a pilgrimage but a truly ancient route across the Apennines. StayBed & Breakfast Nova Arbora , Sasso MarconiThis B&B is a day’s easy walk from Bologna, sitting in its own botanical garden within the Contrafforte Pliocenico nature reserve and right on the route.

Bari-Matera, 170kmSuited to less-experienced walkers, this route, part of the Cammino Materano network, runs across central Puglia into “Lucania” (now Basilicata). Endless olive groves, drystone walls and trulli give way to oak and pine woods, then deep ravines near Matera. Walkers can refuel on crusty Altamura bread (famed since Horace praised it in 37BC) with sheep and goat’s cheese while walking between ancient villages and rock-cut churches. Not one for the hotter months of the year. StayLa Dimora di Federico, AltamuraGreat-value B&B between Altamura and Gravina with simple rooms and breakfasts of local murgiana produce.

EatPecora Nera country pub, Cassano delle MurgeThe Black Sheep pub, 25km from Bari, is a little way out of the village but famous among walkers for its beers and its braised pork shanks. A suggestion – for carnivores – is to eat like a local in Santeramo in Colle, about halfway along the route. Several of the town’s butchers offer hot food to take away or eat at simple paper-covered tables. It’s mostly meat, naturally, with grilled horse a speciality, but lots of other choices, depending on the day.
