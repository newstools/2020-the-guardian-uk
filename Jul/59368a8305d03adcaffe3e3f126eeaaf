Where is the “incoherence” in the Scottish nationalist position that “demands regulatory independence from London, while mourning the fact that regulation is no longer dictated in Brussels” (Editorial, 15 July)? The SNP sides with the majority of the Scottish population in wanting to remain in the EU. Participating as a member state of the EU on the basis of shared values is categorically different from being steamrollered by a Tory government increasingly wedded to a specifically English nationalist agenda. Anne McLaren Liverpool • I still wear my father’s old Crombie coat (Letters, 15 July). When I once asked him how old it was, he said: “It is older than you.” I’m now 65. Not only is it older than me, it feels heavier than me. Barry Norman Drighlington, Leeds • I feel quite angry with the man who “found a fortune in a charity shop” (Experience, 10 July). I wonder what the volunteers from the now closed shop think of his “small anonymous donation” after the book he picked up for 50p raised £16,000 at auction. Geraldine Halsey Hitchin, Hertfordshire • Your advertisement supplement from the UK government about UK holiday destinations (16 July) tells us that Sutherland and Caithness are “as remote as the UK gets”. Remote from where? Paul Brownsey Glasgow • What about “Domocracy” as a descriptor for this shambolic government (Letters, 14 July)? Julian Roberts Ilkley, West Yorkshire
