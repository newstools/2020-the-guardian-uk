As lockdown descended, people across the UK sought comfort and distraction from the coronavirus pandemic from their pets – old and new. Demand – and prices – for puppies soared, and the Dogs Trust was inundated with interest from those wishing to adopt, while reports of thefts of popular breeds also increased. We’d like to hear from people about how their canine friends have helped them cope in lockdown, particularly if you live – or have been shielding – alone. Have you spent more time with your dog during lockdown? Did you buy a new puppy or rescue a dog during this period? If so, how did the buying or rescue process work? And are you worried about how your dog will cope if and when you return to work? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.
