Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Pod 400g of peas. (If you are using frozen, you will need about 150g.) Scrub 350g of young, slim carrots. Slice them in half lengthways and put them in a roasting tin. Trim a medium-sized bulb of fennel, cut it into thin slices, then add it to the carrots. Peel a medium-sized onion, halve and slice it thinly, then toss it with the fennel and carrot in 4 tbsp of olive oil and some salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for 40-45 minutes until tender and the onions have turned pale gold and translucent. Meanwhile, bring a deep pan of water to the boil, place a fine sieve, colander or steamer basket over the top and tip in 200g of coarse bulgur wheat. Cover with a lid and steam for 20 minutes, adding in the peas for the last 5, and occasionally running a fork through the grains to encourage even cooking. Remove them from the heat and transfer to a serving dish. Remove and finely chop the leaves from 20g of parsley, then fold through the bulgur with a fork, adding salt and black pepper as you go. Stir the roasted vegetables and their oil into the bulgur and serve. Enough for 2 Grains of bulgur wheat, like couscous, have a habit of sticking together as they cook. The best way to deal with this is to stir it with the tines of a fork, running it gently through the grains. They will separate easily. Swap the bulgur for fine couscous. The cooking time will be slightly less. Use mograbia in place of the bulgur, boiling it in deep, salted water for about 20-25 minutes until chewily tender. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
