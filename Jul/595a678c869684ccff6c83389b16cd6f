Europe may be opening up but this is the year when many of us will be avoiding airports and ferries and holidaying in the UK. So this week we’d like to hear about little-known and off-the-beaten-track spots within our borders. Few of us will want to spend time in large cities, or take our chances in tourist honeypots. Instead we want to hear about quiet areas, unsung historic monuments and rewarding walking or cycling routes away from the crowds. Beaches would be welcome if they’re reached on foot or bike, and any pubs or cafes recommended must be ones treating the post-lockdown period with sensible caution. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. Please keep your tip to about 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high quality and you are happy to share them, but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder.
