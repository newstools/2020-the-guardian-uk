Scotland’s former captain Greig Laidlaw will be playing for the Japanese Top League side NTT Shining Arcs when the season begins next year. Shining Arcs, based in Chiba, also announced the signings of the Australian flanker Liam Gill and New Zealand hooker Anaru Rangi. Laidlaw, now 34 and a scrum-half, won 76 Test caps during a career that saw him become his country’s second-highest points scorer with 714, behind only Chris Paterson, who managed 809. Laidlaw captained Scotland for 39 of those 76 games, more than any other player. He announced his international retirement following defeat by Japan at last year’s Rugby World Cup. He has played his club rugby in France with Clermont since 2017, with spells at Gloucester and Edinburgh before that. “At last year’s Japan World Cup I was able to experience the culture and meet wonderful fans,” Laidlaw said. “Every time I have visited Japan I was welcomed with a wonderful hospitality.” Laidlaw, Gill and Rangi join a host of top international players in Japan, headlined by New Zealand’s Beauden Barrett. The England lock George Kruis announced in May that he is leaving Wasps for Panasonic Wild Knights. This year’s Top League was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the 2021 season scheduled to start in January.
