Harvey Elliott has signed a first professional contract at Liverpool, with Jürgen Klopp describing the deal as “brilliant news” for the champions. The 17-year-old Elliott, who joined from Fulham last summer, became Liverpool’s second youngest debutant when playing in a Carabao Cup game against MK Dons in September and has made eight appearances in total. The most recent was the winger’s late appearance in the 4-0 win against Crystal Palace at Anfield last month. “Since the first day I’ve walked in, it’s been an indescribable journey,” Elliott told the club’s website. “Now to top it off with my first professional contract is a dream come true for me and my family. I’m excited to see what the future holds and I’m just excited to give everything to the club and the fans. “When I stepped out on the Anfield pitch when I played against Arsenal [in a Carabao Cup game in October] it was an emotional thing for me. To be in and around the fans, to hear them singing You’ll Never Walk Alone when you’re stepping out on the pitch, it did bring a tear to my eye.” Klopp said: “Brilliant news – [I’m] really happy. Harvey is such an exciting prospect. I love his attitude, enthusiasm, bravery – love he has the right amount of football confidence and cheekiness. “The public maybe doesn’t know the real Harvey yet and part of that is because we have looked to shield and protect him. But he is such a nice, polite, humble boy who is appreciative of the talent and opportunity he has – and just loves football. He loves the game first and foremost, would play every minute of every day if he could – and he loves this club also and that’s a nice mixture. “What is critical and so important is that he is given time and space to develop.”
