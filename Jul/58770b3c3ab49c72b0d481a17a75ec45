The London stage version of Frozen has delayed its opening by almost six months as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The musical adaptation of the 2013 Disney blockbuster had been due to reopen the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in October, following a two-year, £60m refurbishment. It will now begin previews on 2 April instead. The Theatre Royal Drury Lane is owned and managed by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s group LW Theatres, which has begun redundancy consultations as a result of the devastating effect the coronavirus has had on the industry. West End theatres remain closed, although this week Regent’s Park Open Air theatre announced it will reopen in August for concert-style performances of Jesus Christ Superstar. Outdoor venues were given permission to open from 11 July as phase three of culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s five-stage “roadmap” for reopening theatres. The casting of Samantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon as Frozen’s sisters Elsa and Anna was announced earlier this year. Further cast members, announced on Friday, include Craig Gallivan as Olaf, the snowman who likes warm hugs, Obioma Ugoala as Kristoff, Oliver Ormson as Hans, Richard Frame as Weselton, and Mikayla Jade and Ashley Birchall who will alternate the role of the faithful reindeer, Sven. The show’s director, Michael Grandage, said: “As theatres start to open their doors again, we look forward to celebrating the spectacle of this beloved story with audiences everywhere.” The stage adaptation of Frozen has an additional set of songs by the film’s married composer-lyricists, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. It opened on Broadway in 2018 and was nominated for a Tony award for best musical. Existing bookings for Frozen will automatically be transferred to a new performance date with the same seats. If the new date is not suitable, an alternative date or a refund can be requested.
