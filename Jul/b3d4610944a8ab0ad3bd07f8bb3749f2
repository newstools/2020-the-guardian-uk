I still wonder why the knife was in my left hand when I pressed it into the watermelon bark blade-side up, pressed it hard and slow and felt it stop at my bone, felt no pain at all as it split my thumb along a perfect meridian. I watched the blood spill its perfect pomegranate seedsinto the aluminium spaceship of the kitchen sink. I was six. I was learning directions. Left became encoded in the scar. Across this slice of spacetime, this half a lifetime, I still glide my index finger over it in animal instinct when asked to orient. Tonight I pressed my thumb meridian into the equator of her bare sole, she whose footfall I recognise across the room,across the gallery, across the galaxy, pressed it hard and slow into the moan of her animal pleasure. No use asking why the knife was in my left hand then, or this particular foot now. Some things we just get wrong, then make use of the scars. Some things we get right only when we cease pressing against the blade of why. Maria Popova is a Bulgarian-born, US-based writer and critic.
