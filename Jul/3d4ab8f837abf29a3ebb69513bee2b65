Last September to celebrate my daughter’s 60th birthday, I used Reader Offers Ltd to book a Hurtigruten cruise to Norway due to depart in May. Needless to say, Covid-19 resulted in its cancellation. Because of my age (84) and the continued prevalence of the virus we requested a full refund rather than vouchers for a future booking. I am still more than £5,000 out of pocket with no prospect of reimbursement. JR, Shropshire Reader Offers Ltd, rebranded as ROL Cruise, was caught up in the perfect storm the Covid-19 crisis has become for the travel sector. Given your age and the continued uncertainty surrounding the virus – and the fact that the law is on your side – it was perfectly reasonable to request a refund. In fairness to ROL, it had said you would be refunded in 90 days. Within a day of us contacting the firm it repaid you and apologised that it took longer than was ideal. Our email continues to run red hot with travel and airline complaints. There are a growing number from readers who accepted vouchers in lieu of a refund and are finding they are unable to use them or not getting what they thought they had been promised. If you are offered vouchers read the terms and conditions very carefully before accepting. If the airline or tour provider cancelled the flight you are entitled to a full refund – you are under no obligation to accept vouchers or a credit note instead.
