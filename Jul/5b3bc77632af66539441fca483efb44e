An 18-year-old man has been arrested over the killing of two sisters in a London park, the Metropolitan police said. The man was arrested at an address in south London overnight on suspicion of the murders of Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, in the early hours of 6 June. DCI Simon Harding, who is leading the inquiry, said: “This investigation into the awful death of two sisters is of course a priority for the [Met] and my officers have been working around the clock to identify the person responsible. “Given the significance of this development, we visited the family in person today to inform them of the arrest. Our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time. “A team of forensic officers have been a constant presence at the park over the last few weeks carrying out meticulous fingertip searches at what is a vast and complex crime scene. “While that work has now concluded, smaller searches in outer areas of the park will continue. To date, officers have recovered more than 1,000 exhibits, including property belonging to Nicole and Bibaa, collected hours of CCTV and visited hundreds of homes and businesses. And those inquiries remain ongoing. “I would continue to appeal to the public to come forward with any information they feel may be relevant to our investigation.”
