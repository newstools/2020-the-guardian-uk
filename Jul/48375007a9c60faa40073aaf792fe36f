This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Leicester Museums, which was established in the 1840s and has a rich and varied collection ranging from a meteorite that is billions of years old to an internationally renowned German expressionist art collection. You can see art from Leicester Museums on Art UK here. Find out more on the website here.
