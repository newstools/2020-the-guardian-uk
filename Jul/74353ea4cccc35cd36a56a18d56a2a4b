After a number of businesses reopened on Saturday, many employees have now returned to their workplace, while others have been continuing to go into work throughout. We’d like to hear from workers about what your workplace is like at the moment, and how it has changed as a result of the pandemic. Perhaps you’ve just returned to the office, or have been working throughout and noticed a change. What new measures are being taken to limit the spread of coronavirus? How have your practices and behaviours changed? Do you have any concerns? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish, or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists will be in contact for publication before we publish, so please do leave contact details. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
