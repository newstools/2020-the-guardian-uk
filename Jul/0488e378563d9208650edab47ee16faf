Milan have handed Stefano Pioli a two-year extension to his contract as head coach after the team went 10 games unbeaten. The club had already offered the job to Ralf Rangnick, who had agreed to take over for the 2020-21 season, and are likely to have to pay the former RB Leipzig manager compensation. Milan announced the news of Pioli’s new contract after they beat Sassuolo 2-1 on Tuesday night, guaranteeing the team a place in next season’s Europa League. Rangnick released a statement saying: “Milan and I have agreed that it is currently not the right time to be working together. Considering this and the development the squad is undergoing, and the results it is producing, under the current coach, Stefano Pioli, we have decided that I will not take a role at the club.” Pioli, who became Milan coach in October 2019, initially on a deal to the end of the season, said: “I am happy and proud of the trust I have received from Milan. I want to thank everyone, including our fans, who we are really missing at the stadium, but are always close and supportive. “As I have said many times, our future is today: we must be focused and determined, be united and play as one. We are at the beginning of an extraordinary path. If we keep working this way, we will grow and be more and more competitive.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in the first half in the win against Sassuolo, which also marked the 200th club appearance for the goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
