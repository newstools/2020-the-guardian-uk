Tottenham are in talks with Internazionale over a deal to sell Tanguy Ndombele for a reduced fee less than 13 months after he became the club’s record signing for £55m. The France midfielder has endured a difficult first season in the Premier League since joining Spurs from Lyon in July last year and signing a six-year deal, having started only 12 Premier League games. But despite José Mourinho stating he was confident the 23-year-old “can turn it around” at the start of July, Inter have entered negotiations that could see Ndombele join Antonio Conte’s side. Spurs have indicated they would accept €50m (£45m) for Ndombele – a figure that would represent a significant loss – although Inter are not believed to be willing to go that high. There is also a possibility of a swap deal involving the Slovakia defender Milan Skriniar, who Mourinho views as a replacement for Jan Vertonghen after the Belgium defender left Spurs at the end of his contract. It is also understood Tottenham are monitoring Ivan Perisic, who has also been linked with a switch to Bayern Munich. They remain favourites but Mourinho is a big admirer of the Croatian having attempted to sign him at Manchester United. Spurs are still in talks over a move for Southampton’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg but have been told Roma have no intention of selling Nicolò Zaniolo.
