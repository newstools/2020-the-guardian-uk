This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by University College London. UCL Art Museum’s collection of about 12,000 artworks has its origins as a teaching and research resource tied to the history of the university’s Slade School of Art. Work by prize-winning artists emerging from the Slade over 150 years sits alongside art spanning five centuries that informed their studies. Forty five per cent of the Slade Collections is work by women artists. You can see art from UCL Art Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the UCL Art Museum website here.
