This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Jerwood Collection of Modern and Contemporary British Art. The collection began in 1993, when the first work was bought by Alan Grieve, chairman of the Jerwood Foundation; it continues to grow with new acquisitions and donations under the direction of Lara Wardle. Holding just under 300 works the collection is widely accessible through loans to national and international institutions and inclusion on a number of digital platforms. Its aim is to enhance the understanding and enjoyment of British art. You can see art from the Jerwood Collection on Art UK here. Find out more on its website here.
