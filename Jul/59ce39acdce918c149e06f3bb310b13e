Picking the greatest female player of the last 50 years was tough. Last week, five of our writers made the case for the leading candidates – Steffi Graf, Chris Evert, Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles – before our tennis correspondent gave his verdict, choosing Williams, and hundreds of our readers joined the debate, with the majority picking Graf as their favourite. Picking the greatest male player may prove even harder. Roger Federer has won the most grand slams, but Rafa Nadal is not far behind and Novak Djokovic may soon overtake them both. And that’s before we even consider players who are not still in action. Pete Sampras, Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg would all fancy their chances of giving the three stars of today’s game a run for their money. Which of these greats was the greatest – or are we missing someone from our shortlist? Tell us your verdict in the form below.
