This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru / The National Library of Wales. The library’s iconic building in Aberystwyth is a treasure trove of Welsh art, history and culture and is home to a wealth of collections that include paintings, manuscripts, archives, journals, newspapers, films, books, photographs and maps, recording the heritage and culture of Wales and the Celtic nations. Access to these resources is free at the library and online at library.wales.You can see art from Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru / The National Library of Wales on Art UK here.
