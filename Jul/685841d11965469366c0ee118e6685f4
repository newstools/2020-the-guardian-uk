In the consideration of larger school protective bubbles, Geoff Barton may be correct that the logistics of keeping children apart will be “mind boggling” (Back to school: what can pupils in England expect from September?, 2 July) but monitoring bubbles could be greatly simplified by the use of different coloured hi-vis waistcoats, which are commonly worn by younger pupils on school trips.Alan D ConnellHarrogate, North Yorkshire • It’s not just Contagion that can help us to cope with Covid-19 (I feel fine: fans of world-ending films ‘coping better with pandemic’, 1 July). Turning to literature, there’s not only Camus’s The Plague and Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year, but Mary Shelley’s The Last Man (1826), which predicts a 21st-century epidemic, in which everyone dies except the title character.Michael BathRochester, Kent • Perhaps there would be room for people on the beaches (Letters, 2 July) if they stood like Antony Gormley’s figures on Crosby Beach, social distancing and facing out to sea.Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • “I don’t believe in gestures,” says Boris Johnson (Politics live, theguardian.com, 3 July) on why he would not take the knee, not so long after being seen clapping for carers outside No 10.Jim GolcherTowcester, Northamptonshire • I am sure that many older Guardian readers will be sorry to learn that the list of countries we are now allowed to visit does not include San Serriffe.Cyril DuffLondon
