This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Hastings Museum & Art Gallery, whose collections cover a multitude of world cultures, archaeological objects, fascinating fossils and more. Hastings Museum’s art collection includes works by some of the most significant British artists of the last few centuries including JMW Turner, Sylvia Gosse, Harry Furniss and Walter Sickert, among a number of wonderful international paintings, prints and sculpture.
