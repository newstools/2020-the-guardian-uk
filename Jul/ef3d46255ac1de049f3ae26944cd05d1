I used to make my own chocolate lollipops and add all manner of inclusions. For my eldest’s holy communion her ‘cake’ was a stand of homemade white chocolate lollies with sugared violets. It’s been ages since I’ve revisited these, but this week my youngest took up the mantle, melting three types of chocolate to make little after-dinner treats. Strictly speaking, you don’t even need moulds, but can just puddle the chocolate on to baking parchment with sticks pushed in before it sets.

The founder of Love Cocoa is James Cadbury, a great, great, great grandson of the original Mr Cadbury. LC is big on ethics: single origin, recyclables and for every product sold one tree is planted to combat deforestation. The main collection consists of 75g bars costing £4, and there are lots of flavours. The hands-down winner with my testers was the 41% salted caramel milk. The strawberry champagne 35% white was just about as close to strawberries and cream in a bar as you can get – not my thing, but if it’s yours, it’s really worth a try. What a surprise the 71% avocado was. Avocado and chocolate is a thing now, and I can never pick out the avocado flavour, but this did make for a really interesting dark bar. Some of the bars also come with messages on them (happy birthday, thank you), and for the price of little more than some greeting cards, are much more interesting. lovecocoa.com This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
