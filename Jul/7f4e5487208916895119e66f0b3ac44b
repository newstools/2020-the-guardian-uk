Please note: these are government figures on numbers of confirmed cases – some people who report symptoms are not being tested, and are not included in these counts. Update 3 July: Public Health England is now including “pillar 1” and “pillar 2” cases for local authorities in England. Many places will have seen an apparent rise in cases, which is chiefly due to this adjustment in the way the data is published. PHE explains the nature of the change here. This data comes from a variety of sources; the headline figures come from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Local authority and health board data comes from the devolved authorities. The cases and deaths by day comes from Johns Hopkins University, although ultimately from the same sources. There are differences in the data collection practices and publishing schedules of the sources that may lead to temporary inconsistencies.
