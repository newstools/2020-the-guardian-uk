Rishi Sunak called it the “eat out to help out” offer. Others said it was “Groupon government”. Either way, the chancellor made clear he wanted to get the nation eating and drinking again – at least from Monday to Wednesday during August. In one of his more surprising proposals, Sunak announced that the government would pay “£10 per head for everyone, including children” for meals at certain restaurants next month. “A first-of-its-kind government-backed discount for all”, he declared. “To get customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs, and protect the 1.8 million people who work in them.” The meal-deal discount will not apply, however, to alcoholic drinks. To get the best value for money, customers are likely to be drawn to “value” restaurants – and ordering meals costing no more than £20 a head. And though many large chains have yet to confirm their intention to register, Pizza Express was one of the first to sign up for the offer. Others that offer meals in the price range and could sign up include: The chain is offering a reduced menu at about 80% of its pubs, with exact prices depending on the area. Although it has yet to confirm that it will sign up to the scheme, if it does, the following three-course meal will cost you just £10.20. Tomato and basil soup: £2.85 Signature steak meal (includes drink): £13.10 Peas: 65p Warm chocolate brownie with ice cream: £3.60 Total before discount: £20.20 Chicken supreme pizza (with free salad): £12.19 Fries: £3.99 Bottle of Pepsi: £3.99 Total before discount: £20.17 The 22-branch chain’s signature beer-infused dish for two – whole British free-range chicken roasted and steamed over a can of B&Ks American Pale Ale – comes with a choice of three sauces and a pick of three sides from 11 options, including macaroni cheese and lemon and garlic broccoli. Total before discount: £24.50 (varies with area).
