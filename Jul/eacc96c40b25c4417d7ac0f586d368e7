Borussia Dortmund have agreed to buy Jude Bellingham from Birmingham City for a fee that could rise to €25m (£22.75m). The 17-year-old midfielder, who is in line for a five-year contract, would follow Jadon Sancho as a young English player to join the Bundesliga club. Bellingham made his Birmingham debut at the start of this season aged 16 years and 38 days and became the club’s youngest goalscorer at 16 days and 63 days, eclipsing Trevor Francis’s records. He has established himself as a first-team regular. The England age-group international has attracted interest from Manchester United and his parents met club executives for talks in March.
