There are now more than 992,000 Australians unemployed with more than 70,000 people having lost their jobs in the last quarter alone. This leaves people relying on welfare or savings while they search for work. But with the general economic downturn, few companies are hiring and even governments are reluctant to add to their wages bill. Casual work in industries such as hospitality and the “gig economy” has also evaporated. That means for every job advertised, there are dozens if not hundreds of applicants. And with unemployment rates predicted to reach as high as 9% by Christmas the job queues are only set to lengthen. If you are searching for work we want to hear from you. Have you applied for jobs only to find out that you were one of hundreds of applicants? Have you been discouraged by the sheer number of people seeking work? And if you are an employer, have you advertised for positions only to be inundated by applicants?
