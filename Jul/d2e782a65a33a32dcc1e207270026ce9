The Conservative backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne says that the requirement for shoppers to wear face masks is a “monstrous imposition”, but covering our faces need not feel so restrictive. Masks protect shopkeepers – who can be up to 75% more likely to die of coronavirus than the general population – and there is no reason they cannot be stylish. If you live in the UK, we want to see the face coverings you have made at home. How did you design and build them? Which materials did you use? Whether you cut up an old T-shirt or spent hours labouring over a sewing machine, we want to see the results. We also want to hear how you feel about your mask. Do you feel more safe and responsible while wearing it and do you agree with the government’s policy on shops and public transport?
