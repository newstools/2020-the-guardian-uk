Marcus Rashford will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester for his “remarkable campaign against child poverty” which caused a government U-turn and the granting of free food vouchers for the poorest families over the summer. Boris Johnson had initially rejected the Manchester United striker’s calls before the prime minister reversed his decision last month. Rashford grew up in Wythenshawe, south Manchester, and will become the university’s youngest recipient of the award. It also recognises his “outstanding sporting achievements”. The 22-year-old said: “It’s a proud day for myself and my family. When you look at the great names that have been awarded this doctorate in the past, it’s humbling. We still have a long way to go in the fight to combat child poverty in this country but receiving recognition from your city means we are heading in the right direction and that means a lot.” Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Bobby Charlton and Vincent Kompany are among the football figures to have received the award. Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell, the university president and vice-chancellor, said: “Marcus is an extraordinary young man with an extraordinary talent and drive that stretches well beyond the football field. His work for charity and his high-profile campaign will not only help countless young people across our own city but across the entire country. “Our university has social responsibility at its core and this sense of civic pride and duty is something we are proud to share with Marcus. That is why the university is delighted to make Marcus our youngest-ever recipient of an honorary degree.” United’s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, said: “We’re so proud of Marcus and I’ve said it a few times, the great person he is and a great human being who cares so much more about others than himself. Very proud of him and hopefully he’ll keep his personality for the rest of his life and be himself.”
