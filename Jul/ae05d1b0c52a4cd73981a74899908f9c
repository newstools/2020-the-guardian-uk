Like footballers and boxers, pop stars have careers that rarely get better in their 30s, the exhilaration of youth collapsing into middle-aged mediocrity, experience elbowed aside by promise. This is British pop queen Ellie Goulding’s first thirtysomething album – and her first set in five years – and it’s awkwardly divided into two unequal parts, one with 13 songs, the other with five. The first half is “vulnerable side” Brightest Blue, while the much shorter addendum EG.0 offers a symphonic overture and modish hits with Swae Lee and the late Juice WRLD. EG.0 she oddly labels her “confident side”, even as she shelters in other people’s starlight. Goulding usually prefers to appear unthreatening and relatable rather than demand adoration, and that doesn’t change here, but her quality control has improved. The slower songs of part one are best, particularly the three-punch combo of Bleach, Flux and Brightest Blue, the last delivering an indelible chorus over pillowy synths and delicate harmonies. True, her say-what-you-see lyrics are still too pedestrian; seas remain dark and stormy, lines between opposing things are thin. Yet the music often soars. Goulding should trust herself more: she might need more ego, but she doesn’t need EG.0.
