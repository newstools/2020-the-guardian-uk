This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Wolverhampton Art Gallery. The gallery has more than 18,000 items in its collection, ranging from objects reflecting the history and geology of the Black Country to artworks and decorative objects from across the centuries. It is particularly known for its British and American pop art, its Northern Ireland collection and artwork linked to the British black arts movement.
