You report that evidence from scientists supports the wearing of face masks, and describe the case as being supported by the president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan (No 10 must promote face mask use more forcefully, experts warn, 7 July). Your report, however, gives the impression that some opinions differed, suggesting a meaningful degree of doubt about the efficacy of masks. It will almost always be the case that evidence is “mixed” in strength and quality, and sometimes in its conclusions. However, this depiction of the evidence significantly misrepresents the strength of the case for wearing masks. The rapid review conducted for the Royal Society and British Academy by Melinda Mills draws on a wide net of evidence (not just supportive evidence) and includes both statistical and narrative analysis to underpin its conclusions. The weight of this evidence clearly supports the more widespread and consistent use of face masks in a variety of contexts. I would urge anyone who wants to understand this to read the report itself. The sooner the UK government acts on this evidence the better.Dominic AbramsVice-president, British Academy
