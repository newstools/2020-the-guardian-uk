This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Harris Museum, Art Gallery and Library, in Preston, Lancashire. The Harris’s fine art collection was founded in 1883, when Richard Newsham bequeathed his art collection to the city. The Harris has continued to build the collection for more than 125 years, including the local favourite, Pauline in the Yellow Dress by Sir James Gunn. The gallery has been helped by the Contemporary Art Society, whose numerous donations include Lucian Freud’s Still Life with Squid and Sea Urchin. You can see art from the Harris Museum, Art Gallery and Library on Art UK here. Find out more on the Harris website here.
