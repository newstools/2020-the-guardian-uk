This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Rugby Art Gallery and Museum. The renowned Rugby Collection of modern British and contemporary art contains more than 200 artworks in a variety of media from painting and prints to drawing and video, including works by Barbara Hepworth, LS Lowry, Stanley Spencer, Paula Rego and Graham Sutherland. The collection was started by Rugby borough council in 1946 and has been housed at Rugby Art Gallery and Museum since the gallery opened in 2000.
