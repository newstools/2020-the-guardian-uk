This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home of the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues, by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK sets the questions. Today, our questions are set by Government Art Collection. It is the most dispersed collection of British art in the world, with works displayed in more than 365 buildings and in 155 capital cities worldwide. The collection promotes British art and plays a key role in cultural diplomacy. Works can also be seen by the wider UK public through exhibition loans, digitally and partnership projects. You can see art from the collection on Art UK here. Find out more on the Government Art Collection website here.
