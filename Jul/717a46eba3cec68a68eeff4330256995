The last whodunnit featuring the famed Sicilian police inspector Salvo Montalbano has hit the shelves in Italy, nearly a year to the day after the death of the author Andrea Camilleri. Riccardino was first penned in 2005 and then tweaked in 2016, after which Camilleri gave it to his publisher on the promise that it would not be released until after his death. He died on 18 July 2019 at the age of 93. Fans are in for a special treat: not only do they get another murder for grumpy Montalbano to resolve but Camilleri himself makes an appearance. He turns up to tick off his detective after he is reluctant to get on with the new case, according to an extract of the novel published by the Corriere della Sera newspaper. “I offer you a lead and you mess around, and I find myself in trouble. As a writer, I mean. We can’t go on like this, you have to start investigating,” he tells him sternly in a telephone call. An unimpressed Montalbano hangs up on him. The Riccardino of the title gets bumped off on page nine. Montalbano also reportedly takes a bow, though Camilleri had promised fans he would not kill off his gruff, food-loving sleuth. “The fact that Montalbano, unlike other serial characters such as Sherlock Holmes or Maigret, gets older, takes part in everyday life, makes it increasingly difficult for me to keep up with him,” he said in an interview in 2005. “So I decided to write the final novel. But he doesn’t end up getting shot or retiring.” Initially a theatre and television director and scriptwriter, Camilleri became a novelist later in life. He published his first book at the age of 57. The politically engaged author, who never shied away from criticising those in power, went on to sell about 20 m books in Italy and publish 30-odd novels featuring Montalbano, which have been translated into about 30 languages.
