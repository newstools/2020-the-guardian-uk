Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We’ve been having a terrible problem with moths – they’ve had a go at clothes and a wool rug. What’s the best way to get rid of them? Is it worth paying someone to come in or are there effective DIY cures? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
