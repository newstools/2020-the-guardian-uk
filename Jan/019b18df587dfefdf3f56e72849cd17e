I have a group of six close friends whom I have known for ages. We hang out all the time. About six months ago, someone new joined the group. Unfortunately, we clash; I find him arrogant and abrasive and I suspect he’s not too fond of me, either. I have tried to get along with him, but I find him extremely annoying. My other friends love him. How do I phase him out? Or should I just grin and bear it? It has got to the point where I have started to dread group events as I know he will be there. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
