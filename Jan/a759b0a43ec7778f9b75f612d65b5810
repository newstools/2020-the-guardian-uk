Please send us your tips on Europe’s less heralded lines (excluding the UK) – including scenic branch lines, local lines and rural routes serving smaller towns and the countryside. Perhaps the line revealed interesting history or featured quirky stations and beautiful landscapes. To give you some inspiration, here’s our pick of 10 great local routes (please don’t send a tip about one of these). Please don’t include dedicated heritage lines with steam trains – shortlisted tips will be about “working’ routes rather than purely for visitors or nostalgia. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including useful websites and prices) in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and the winner will receive two first-class Interrail Global Passes from Eurail that allow for seven days of travel within one month, and are worth up to £384 each (depending on the age of the traveller). This competition closes at 10am GMT on Wednesday 5 February 2020, and a selection of entrants will be published on or soon after Friday 7 February.
