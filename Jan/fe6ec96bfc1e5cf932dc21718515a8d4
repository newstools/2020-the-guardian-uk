VIP schemes have been cited in the majority of regulatory sanctions issued against gambling companies for failure to prevent problem gambling. Here, two recovering addicts explain how VIP status contributed to their loss of control. Nick Firth, 29, from Bradford, was a VIP gambler with Betfair. Like many addicts, the level of his gambling increased after he had a big win and he was made a VIP. Firth says: “We’re talking about Thailand Division 3 women’s under-19 football. Teams that I’ve never heard of [betting] at 3am in the morning, just to get my fix. I actually stole some money from my ex-girlfriend’s mum, about £10,000. She was giving us a house deposit and I gambled every single penny on the Betfair website. I kept going and going, chasing the losses. They gave me the VIP status during that period.” Emails shared with the Guardian showed Betfair offered him free bets and football tickets “providing you maintain your VIP status”. Betfair declined to comment. Phil Worrall, 33, from Nottingham, had VIP status with several companies and said it kept him coming back for more. Worrall says: “The more you bet, the more you’ll get given free bets and the more likely that you give it straight back. It keeps you coming back. “You might think you’ve got no money left but if you get an email saying you’ll get a £50 free bet if you bet £50 of your own money, you find a way to scrape it together. It’s a little hook back in. “The whole industry needs to be thoroughly cracked down on because it’s like the mob. This nation is putting a fortune into it every weekend and they’re thriving on misery. VIP schemes are just a part of that system.”
