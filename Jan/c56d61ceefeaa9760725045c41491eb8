Jack Rodwell feels he has “a point to prove at the highest level” after a prolonged absence from the Premier League and that Sheffield United is the perfect place to do it. Rodwell ended a six-month exile from the game last week when he signed for United, and he made his debut during the FA Cup victory over AFC Fylde on Sunday. The 28-year-old had been without a club since leaving Blackburn at the end of last season. He said he turned down numerous opportunities, including a new deal at the Championship team. “It was just about staying patient and waiting,” Rodwell said. “There were plenty of offers on the table during that period out of the game but it was about finding the right home for me at this stage of my career. The other offers didn’t seem right but this one was perfect. It’s a great club, the manager [Chris Wilder] is obviously brilliant and I feel like I’ve still got a point to prove at the highest level, so it ticked every box.” Rodwell has not made a Premier League appearance since May 2017, for Sunderland, but that run could end on Friday when United host West Ham. “I feel like I’ve got more to offer at this level for sure,” he said. “I’m still capable of playing at the highest level. “That remains my ambition. I’m very ambitious and nothing has changed there. I’ve got to be patient and show the right attitude, but I will be ready whenever I’m called upon.” Among the clubs who showed an interest in Rodwell were Roma, who came close to offering a short-term deal in October before turning their attention elsewhere. “That was very close to happening,” he said. “It was just unfortunate circumstances why it didn’t materialise but things are meant to happen for a reason, aren’t they? Fast forward a few weeks and I got the call from Sheffield United, so it’s swings and roundabouts. That wasn’t meant to be but this was, and I’m delighted to be here.”
