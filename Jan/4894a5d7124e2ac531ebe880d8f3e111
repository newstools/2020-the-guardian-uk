Alastair Campbell is unlikely to get a Brexit 50p coin in his change (Pass notes: The Brexit 50p, G2, 28 January). Only 10 million are being circulated out of about 1,250 million since they were resized in 1997. This is trivial compared with 89,775,000 “hands of friendship” coins which marked the UK joining the EEC in 1973, out a circulation of under 300 million. At the time, my French grandmother gave us these coins to celebrate, having had to become British when she married in 1922 before dual citizenship was possible. Following Brexit her descendants will no longer have the right to live and work in the EU. All I can hope this Friday is that Led By Donkeys can project a farewell message on to the white cliffs of Dover, and that one day we will be back playing a constructive role at the heart of Europe. David Nowell New Barnet, Hertfordshire • I will be donating any Brexit 50p coins that come my way to Asylum Welcome, an Oxford charity that supports asylum seekers and refugees. If other Guardian readers did something similar, the coins would at least be put to good use.Margaret SimonOxford • If I receive one of the Brexit 50p pieces I shall send it to my MP, who happens to be Ben Wallace but almost any of them would do, with a note saying: “Here is your piece of silver.”Nicholas CutlerInglewhite, Lancashire • Regarding the message on the new 50p piece – “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” – the absence of the comma before the “and” in this case is not just a question of convention, but seems to alter the message so that it is not just our friendship that is to be with all nations, but also our peace and prosperity.
