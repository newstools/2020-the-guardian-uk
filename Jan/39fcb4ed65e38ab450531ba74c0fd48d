Jordan Hugill scored twice as QPR thrashed Swansea 5-1. In-form Bright Osayi-Samuel also netted for Rangers, who were three up by half-time. George Byers struck for Swansea but Lee Wallace’s brilliant volley with 14 minutes remaining and an even better strike from Josh Scowen in added time completed the rout. League Two Northampton will be in the hat after despatching Burton 4-2. Nicky Adams, Ryan Watson and Charlie Goode put the visitors into a three-goal lead before Ryan Edwards pulled one back. Sam Hoskins ensured there would be no comeback with a fourth but Scott Fraser did add a late consolation. Kenneth Zohore’s winner booked West Brom a fourth-round spot at the expense of Championship rivals Charlton with a 1-0 success. Zahore played a neat one-two with Kyle Edwards before coolly slotting a low shot past Phillips from 10 yards. Conor Chaplin and Luke Thomas ensured Championship strugglers Barnsley progressed to the fourth round for the first time in seven years with a 3-1 win at Crewe. The Yorkshire side were ahead as early through Jacob Brown, but Paul Green equalised. Chaplin restored Barnsley’s lead with a poacher’s finish. Then with goalkeeper Will Jaaskelainen up in the visiting box for a free kick in stoppage time Kenny Dougall released Thomas to complete the scoring. Bristol Rovers and Coventry will have to do it all against after a 2-2 draw ast the Memorial Ground.
