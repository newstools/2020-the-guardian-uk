The bushfires have been spreading across New South Wales and Victoria and are set to worsen by the end of this week. Here is what we know so far about the state of the fires on 1 January 2020. At least four people have died in NSW, while another person remains unaccounted for in that state. Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for four people after fires tore through large swathes of East Gippsland on Tuesday. NSW police confirmed the fourth death on Wednesday, saying in a statement that a body had been found at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola. The two men killed in fires at Cobargo have been named as Patrick Salway and his father, Robert Salway. It is expected hundreds of homes have been destroyed on the NSW south coast, though the RFS says it is still conducting assessments. The ABC reported 50 properties lost in the town of Conjola Park. Victorian authorities say about 50 properties have been lost across Buchan, Sarsfield and Mallacoota, but that figure is expected to rise. More than 100 fires are burning in NSW, but conditions have eased and all fires have been downgraded to watch and act level. Three fires are burning at emergency level in Victoria as a dozen burn across the east and north-east. Firefighters in NSW are using the improved conditions to contain existing fires and prepare for Saturday, which is tipped to rival Tuesdayâ€™s fire danger levels.
