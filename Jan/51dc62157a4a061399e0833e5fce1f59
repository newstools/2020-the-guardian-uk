I thought 1 April had arrived early when I read about the £3.5m bill for preserving Derek Jarman’s cottage (Report, 23 January). What could cost such a staggering sum? Are they running a branch line from HS1 to it? The cabin is delightful and in a sublime location, but this amount to preserve it is beyond belief.Graeme MooneyBlackpool • At 85, I am still making marmalade (Letters, 27 January), at the only time of the year when I am allowed control of the kitchen. I remain competitive, coming second in the village show in 2019, but after several lean years. However, a jar of my marmalade, unplaced in Suffolk, was taken to Somerset, rebranded, and came first in a WI competition there. A prophet not honoured in his own county perhaps?Alan MackleyBlythburgh, Suffolk • Re your article (How to share a kitchen – without fighting, G2, 23 January), I sit back and attempt the Guardian cryptic crossword while my engineer husband goes around in a precise way, everything lined up, producing a meal but creating havoc. I don’t say a word.Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • Back in the 1970s, when I was a counsellor at a summer camp in Ohio, I complained to colleagues one day about the state of my hair, due to the wind. One of them replied: “What you need is a good shag” (Letters, 24 January).Lalita Carlton-JonesLlandudno, Clwyd • Next Sunday it is my wife’s birthday and, on checking the date, I found it is a perfect palindrome 02.02.2020. This is rather uncommon and I don’t think there’ll be many as perfect as this one. It’s just a pity she’s not 20 any more.John BrittenWatford, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
