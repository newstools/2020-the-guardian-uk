Tottenham are pushing to sign the £30m-rated winger Steven Bergwijn from PSV Eindhoven. The north London club are ready to sell Christian Eriksen to Inter for €20m (£16.7m) and they have identified Bergwijn as a player to increase their attacking options. The 22-year-old prefers to operate off the left, although he can play as a No 10. Bergwijn’s agent is understood to be in England to explore a move for his client, with Leicester also interested in a player who is a strong candidate to start for the Netherlands at Euro 2020. Bergwijn was a target for Sevilla last summer but he stayed put and signed a new contract, which runs until 2023. PSV say that they have no agreement with Spurs as it stands but the wheels are in motion, with Bergwijn having been omitted from the starting lineup for Sunday afternoon’s game against FC Twente. The interim coach, Ernest Faber, said that Bergwijn had asked to be excluded as he was close to a transfer. “It’s his choice,” Faber said. “We only need players who are 100% focused on PSV.” Spurs have already signed the midfielder Gedson Fernandes from Benfica on an 18-month loan with an option to make the deal permanent as they contend with a serious injury to Moussa Sissoko. José Mourinho also wants a new striker, with Harry Kane out until mid-April at least with a ruptured hamstring tendon.
