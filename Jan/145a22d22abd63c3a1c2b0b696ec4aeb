However, the second interviewer confirmed that in this mining community we had almost discovered groupthink.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
