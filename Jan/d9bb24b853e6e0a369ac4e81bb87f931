In 1998 Julian Piper invited us to go and interview the American blues guitarist Phil Guy, who was staying with him at his home in Topsham, Wiltshire. Phil, the brother of Buddy Guy, was a brilliant bluesman and perfect for our Blues Archive project of recording on video the life stories of blues musicians. Later we filmed Julian and his Junkyard Angels backing Phil in a supercharged performance at the 100 Club in London, released recently on video as Phil Guy: My Blues, Baby.
