A volcano near the Philippines capital has spewed ash up to nine miles (15km) into the sky, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people, the cancellation of flights and warnings of a possible explosive eruption and volcanic tsunami. Taal volcano, one of the country’s most active, is in the middle of a lake about 45 miles south of Manila. As tremors shook the area on Sunday, volcanic lightning flickered in the column of steam and ash. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) raised its alert level to 4 out of 5 – meaning “hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days”. Phivolcs also warned of possible hazards of a volcanic tsunami and rapid currents of hot gas and volcanic matter that could hit areas around Lake Taal, a popular weekend getaway from Manila. Evacuation of about 8,000 residents from the volcano island and other high-risk towns is under way, with about 6,000 already out of the danger zone by early Sunday evening, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council told reporters. Ash fell as far away as Manila, prompting the suspension of flights at the capital’s busy international airport. General manager Ed Monreal said the suspension would continue into Monday because there was ash on the runway. Local authorities cancelled school classes scheduled for Monday and urged people to stay indoors. President Rodrigo Duterte had instructed authorities to move people within the perimeter of Taal out of the danger zone, his spokesman said in a statement. The ash plume was clearly visible from the nearby city of Tagaytay, a popular viewing spot for the volcano. Jon Patrick Yen, who was at a restaurant in Tagaytay at the time, said: “We were having lunch when we heard rumbling. We saw the volcano erupting. It rained and some small pebbles fell to the ground. “I did not expect to see such spectacle. We just went by to eat.”
