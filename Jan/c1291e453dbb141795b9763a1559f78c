We are big fans here of crosswords in fiction. Sadly, when it comes to TV and film, sometimes a puzzle appears on screen so briefly that it is not possible to see all of the clues and grid. Case in point: the BBC’s Dracula. In episode three, we hear a clue … 12ac Unscrupulous doctor deployed tanner’s knife (12) … and see a glimpse of the puzzle, but nothing more. Happily, the Guardian is in touch with the setter of that clue and its puzzle, despite setter, clue and puzzle being fictional. So, for your pleasure, here it is.
