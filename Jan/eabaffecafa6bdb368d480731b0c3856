The Duchess of Sussex has returned to Canada as the Queen and other senior royals took decisive action and ordered their teams to find a “workable solution” to Prince Harry and Meghan’s future roles. The couple had only recently arrived in the UK after spending an extended festive break in the Commonwealth country but she is now back with the couple’s baby son, Archie, who remained behind, reportedly looked after by a nanny and friends of the duchess. A spokeswoman for Meghan said: “I can confirm she is in Canada.” It follows Harry and Meghan’s bombshell announcement that they are to “step back” from the royal family and split their time between Britain and North America. A Buckingham Palace source said the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge had asked aides to work “at pace” with governments and the Sussex household to find a solution to the couple’s plans to become financially independent royals. It is understood Meghan was always due to return to Canada after a brief return trip to the UK. A source told PA Media “she came back to attend some meetings and then went back”.
