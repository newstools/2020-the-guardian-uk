Tyson Fury has vowed to knock Deontay Wilder out in the second round of their eagerly anticipated heavyweight rematch on 22 February. They go head-to-head at Las Vegas’ MGM Grand Garden Arena, 14 months after their controversial first bout. Fury outboxed the World Boxing Council champion despite suffering two knockdowns, but the match was drawn and he said: “Deontay knows he was rocked three or four times in the last fight and I didn’t have the gas to finish him. This time I can turn that screwdriver until he is gone. “You are going to sleep in two rounds. I keep having the same dream about round two. I am playing poker and I get dealt the number two card. He is getting knocked out in round two, 100%. “I am going to get that green belt. I am also going to get the Ring Magazine and I am also going to keep my lineal championship too and, if he wants to rematch again, no problem. You beat a man once, you beat him again, you beat him three times in a row.” Fury has teamed up with Javan ‘Sugar’ Hill – nephew of the legendary trainer Emmanuel Steward – after splitting from Ben Davison. Explaining the decision, he said: “I know I am not going to get a decision in the United States. I hired him for a knockout. That’s the game plan. If I wasn’t looking for a knockout, I would have kept hold of Davison.” Wilder said: “I am prepared more than ever for this fight. I knocked him out the first time. I told Fury two years ago I was going to baptise him and I did just that. Rising up is part of the baptism. “I told him he was going to go ‘timber’ and he did just that. This time around it is called unfinished business and he won’t be able to get back up. I am going to knock him out.”
