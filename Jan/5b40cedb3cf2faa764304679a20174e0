Coco Khan’s column is an insight into a world I can barely comprehend (Adult learner, Weekend, 4 January). I retired 14 years ago so I am woefully out of touch with the world of work, but I cannot recall ever failing to use my whole leave allowance. I too have given up the two-week holiday, but only because I no longer have the stamina to keep going that long. Don’t be intimidated, Coco; keep taking those breaks. Rodney Smith Chapelton, South Lanarkshire • I have nothing against comfort blankets – one of my children was devoted to theirs. However, Keir Starmer’s past career does not suggest that he is soft, fluffy or lightweight (Starmer would be the ‘comfort blanket’ choice, but does the party need to reset after wipeout?, 4 January). Please can we have a proper analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate for the Labour leadership?Dr Janet DobsonYork • If Sir Keir Starmer were to decide that he did not want to be a member of the same club as Sir Iain Duncan Smith he could renounce his knighthood and become a shoo-in for leadership of the Labour party.Mike DixonManchester • Re letters about getting older (3 and 5 January), my (glass half-empty) partner’s New Year’s Day greeting was “Welcome to our last decade”. I’m 70, and I intend to prove him wrong.
