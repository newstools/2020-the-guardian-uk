Katherine Parkinson is to star in a new stage version of the 1970s sitcom The Good Life in the role originated by Felicity Kendal. Parkinson will play Barbara Good, who attempts to achieve a sustainable existence at home in Surbiton with her husband, Tom (played on screen by Richard Briers). The couple give over their garden to pigs, chickens and a goat named Geraldine, much to the frustration of their neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter (Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington). The play is adapted by Jeremy Sams from the TV show by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey and promises to mix familiar scenarios from the programme, which ran for four series from 1975 to 1978, as well as new material. Sams also directs the play, which has its world premiere at the Theatre Royal Bath in June. The production, which should chime with today’s increased pursuit of sustainability, claims to “celebrate a time when, whatever our differences, we still managed to get on with our neighbours”. Parkinson’s last West End role was in Laura Wade’s play Home, I’m Darling as the vintage frock-loving Judy, who lives like a 1950s housewife in the 21st century. Further casting for The Good Life is yet to be announced.
