Iran’s only female Olympic medallist has said she intends to leave the Islamic republic, in a blistering online statement in which she describes herself as “one of the millions of oppressed women in Iran”. Taekwondo athlete Kimia Alizadeh posted the statement on Instagram as Iran’s semi-official ISNA news agency said she had left for the Netherlands. She criticised the mandatory wearing of the hijab and accused officials in Iran of sexism and mistreatment. “Whatever they said, I wore,” Alizadeh wrote in the statement, posted on Saturday. “Every sentence they ordered, I repeated.” She described the decision to leave Iran as difficult, but necessary. There was no immediate reaction from Iranian authorities. ISNA said Alizadeh had been reported injured and unable to compete. Their report suggested she may try to compete under another nation’s flag at the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo. Alizadeh, 21, won a bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Her departure comes amid high tensions between Iran and the United States. In recent years, many Iranian athletes have left their country, citing government pressure. In September, Saeid Mollaei, an Iranian judo fighter, left the country for Germany. He said Iranian officials had forced him to not compete with an Israeli athlete. Alireza Faghani, an Iranian international soccer referee, left Iran for Australia last year.
