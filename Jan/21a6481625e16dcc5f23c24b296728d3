Michele Gelfand’s article (Authoritarians thrive on fear. We need to help people feel safe, Journal, 3 January) describes through the lens of psychology the vicious spiral of how fear-based reasoning results in a craving for authoritarianism. Politicians would do well to look further at this discipline. The need to feel safe is hardwired into humans: we would not survive without it. When afraid, children seek proximity to a trusted person, perceived as more competent than themselves – an empathic parent or caregiver, who comforts, reassures and solves problems. These raw bases of attachment behaviours carry over into adult life. When fearful, we turn to friends and family, to those in the caring professions and to our political leaders. If our security needs are unmet, we feel abandoned. The polyvagal theory of the neuroscientist Stephen Porges further demonstrates not only the power of trusted others to help override our fear response, but that many of these safety cues are non-verbal. Political leaders need to face down media scare tactics while promoting policies, values and ideals perceived as offering hope – the promise of a secure future. They must also project a personal presence, through facial expression, body language and vocal sound (prosody) that, below our conscious radar, communicates a sense of safety. These are the reasons that Thatcher lowered her voice, Wilson appeared in public with a pipe, and Johnson with a dog.
