Above-inflation rail fare increases (Rise in commuter fares prompts call for rethink, 2 January)? Not in Wales. Transport for Wales, a not-for-profit operator, has announced rail fare cuts. There will be a 10% cut for services in north Wales and some Cardiff and Valleys services. An overall reduction of at least 1% for all Wales and Borders services. Free off-peak travel for under-16s, free travel for under-11s and new railcards for 18-year-olds (50% off standard fares) and students (34% off). New rolling stock, more staff at stations, improved stations, and more frequent services are all planned for the next few years. Eventually there’ll be an Oyster-style card for bus and train travel. Joined-up transport planning and provision that means we can finally ditch the car.Phil ColemanSwansea • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
