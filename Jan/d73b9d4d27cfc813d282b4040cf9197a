The Getafe midfielder Marc Cucurella has denied using racist language towards Real Madrid’s Éder Militão during Saturday’s 3-0 defeat by Zinedine Zidane’s side in La Liga. Cucurella released a statement on Twitter in response to reports he had used the word “mico”, Spanish for “monkey”, during an altercation with the Brazilian defender, saying he had used the word “pico”, which is Spanish slang for “mouth”. The Spaniard, 21, wrote: “I would like clarify that at no point did I insult or belittle Militão. My words were ‘Shut your mouth’. I wish to apologise if anyone felt offended by that. “These are the only declarations I have made or will make on this matter.” Militão, who joined Real from Porto last year for a reported €40m, did not make any comment on the incident. Real declined to comment.
