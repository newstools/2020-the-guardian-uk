Irish police are investigating after three children were found dead in a house. A woman in her 40s was taken to hospital after the bodies of two boys and a girl were found in a home in a small housing development in the village of Newcastle, south-west of Dublin. It is understood the three children were all aged under 10. Irish police have described the deaths as unexplained and are not believed to be looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. The children were found in a house in a small housing development in the village. Garda forensic officers were continuing to work inside the semi-detached house late on Friday night. The local councillor, Emer Higgins, described the events as an “unimaginable tragedy”. “My thoughts are with everybody impacted,” the Fine Gael representative said. “This is a really tight-knit community, it’s a small area, it’s a quiet area, and it’s just unthinkable that something like this could be happening on our doorstep. “It’s so tragic. It’s unbelievable that three young people’s lives could be cut short like that, in what seems to be a particularly tragic case.” A garda incident room had been set up in Clondalkin garda station and gardaí have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
