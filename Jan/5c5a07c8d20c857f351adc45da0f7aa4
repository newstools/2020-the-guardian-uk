Celtic maintained their two-point advantage over Premiership title challengers Rangers with a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. Odsonne Édouard fired the visitors into the lead in the 25th minute before Leigh Griffiths added a second at the start of the second half. Celtic looked to be comfortably heading towards victory before Nicke Kabamba pulled one back with a 66th-minute header, but Christopher Jullien nodded home from a corner seven minutes later to secure victory. Jermain Defoe’s 16th goal of the season enabled Rangers to secure a hard-fought 1-0 win over St Mirren. They had struggled at a similar point last season and almost stumbled against a resolute defence but Defoe tapped home in the 34th minute. Paul Hanlon struck a late winner as Hibernian came back from a goal behind to defeat Hamilton 2-1. Hibs looked in trouble when Alex Gogic scored in the 18th minute but Christian Doidge equalised and Hanlon’s 86th-minute header sealed the comeback win. Liam Donnelly scored the only goal of the game as third-placed Motherwell extended the gap between themselves and Aberdeen, who are fourth, to four points. Scott Pittman netted the winner to give Livingston a 1-0 win over St Johnstone, while Ross County and bottom-placed Hearts played out a goalless draw.
