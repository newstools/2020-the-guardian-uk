If you’ve managed to make it all the way through dry January without a single slip-up, congratulations; and here’s a refreshing reintroduction to booze to kickstart the rest of the year. It’s not too strong, either, so is perfect for a weekend brunch. Serves 1 50ml gin – we use Tanqueray25ml lime juice15ml agave syrup¼ very ripe fresh avocado, peeled and dicedGinger beer, to top1 slice lime (fresh or dehydrated), to garnish Put the gin, lime juice, syrup and avocado in a shaker, add a big handful of ice, and shake hard for 10-15 seconds, so you really bruise the avocado. Double strain into a whisky glass, top with ginger beer and garnish with lime. • Alex Ciale, head bartender at Kerridge’s Bar & Grill, London WC2.
