Cut 1kg of big and floury potatoes, such as Maris Piper, into large pieces as you might for roasting, then cook for 20 minutes or so in deep, lightly boiling water. Cut 250g of pancetta into 2 x 4cm pieces. Cut 12 brussels sprouts in half. Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the pancetta to the frying pan and let it cook over a moderate heat until the fat is pale gold and translucent. Remove the pancetta with a draining spoon and set aside. Put the brussels sprouts into the hot fat and cook them for 5 minutes or so, turning once or twice, until they are bright in colour and tender. Drain and mash the potatoes, adding the fat from the pancetta pan and a little ground black pepper. Crumble 150g of blue cheese into the mash and stir lightly with a fork. Add the brussels sprouts and pancetta and serve. Enough for 2. I like to cook the sprouts a little more for this recipe than I would if serving them as a side dish. The slightly softer texture is pleasing with the mash and crisp pancetta. Use pancetta in the block rather than in thin rashers, so the pieces are more like large lardons rather than shreds. Field mushrooms, the large flat variety, would make a good substitute for the pancetta. They will need a little more oil in which to cook, as they tend to sponge it up. Most blue cheeses are suitable in this recipe, particularly the softer sorts, such as gorgonzola or roquefort, as they melt easily into the hot mashed potato, but other soft cheeses will work well, too. Failing that, use a good grated farmhouse cheddar instead. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
