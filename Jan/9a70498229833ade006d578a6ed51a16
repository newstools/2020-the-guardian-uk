Australia’s bushfire crisis has dominated international news, leading newspapers worldwide, influencing US presidential primary campaigns and attracting celebrity concern from across the globe. In the US, with the 2020 election’s first Democratic caucus in Iowa just under a month away, the Australian bushfires have been cited as evidence of a global climate crisis, and the need for urgent action. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said the world’s future depended on collective action to address climate change – a Rooseveltian Green “new deal” – and said climate denialists needed only look at Australia’s experience for evidence of the dangers of delaying action. I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: Look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.  Our futures are all connected. That is why we must bring the world together and enact a Green New Deal. pic.twitter.com/GBQQpDc4vE Kim Kardashian West retweeted Sanders and said: Climate change is real 💔🌎 Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren argued similarly for a global climate deal (the US has indicated its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement). The catastrophic scenes from Australia's wildfires should alarm all of us. Climate change is driving even more dangerous and destructive fires across the world, from California to New South Wales—and we must fight together to defeat this crisis. https://t.co/DQMd9O75mt Cory Booker also asked supporters to contribute to bushfire relief appeals. The devastating Australian bushfires are taking lives, destroying homes and displacing communities. Hundreds of millions of animals are estimated to have been killed and entire species could be wiped out. This is a crisis and should be front-page news. Please help out if you can. https://t.co/I0kCNWAZPh The fires have attracted attention from all over the world (and from all sides of the political divide), from Bette Midler to Piers Morgan. Pity the poor #Australians, their country ablaze, and their rotten @ScottMorrisonMP saying, “This is not the time to talk about Climate Change. We have to grow our economy.” What an idiot. What good is an economy in an uninhabitable country? Lead, you fuckwit!! Morrison got what he deserved... absolutely unconscionable for a Prime Minister to holiday in Hawaii as his nation burns. https://t.co/mT9jlcPO5Q Newspapers in London led with the Australian bushfires, in particular a striking shot of a kangaroo fleeing a wall of flames. Australian fires dominating international news... pic.twitter.com/cGGm8xO0fF Domestically, the quiet coverage of the fires by Murdoch-owned News Corp papers has attracted interest. Former Victorian premier Steve Bracks accused the Australian of partisan coverage of the bushfire crisis. No reported criticism of the Prime Minister in today’s Australian. (Apart from a confected defence of the PM from Tony Shepherd!!) Obviously they don’t think the Cobargo protest or International criticism newsworthy enough. Have we ever seen such media outlet partisanship. Little of the coverage or public response has praised the Australian government’s reaction to the crisis. Even the prime minister’s avowed favourite singer, Tina Arena, took to Instagram to condemn Australia’s climate inaction.

No prizes for guessing to whom this was directed by Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley. Leadership is hard. Put your hand up and accept what could have been done better, by you and by others. Then accept the vitriol, the hurt and the pain. Listen, understand and empathize. Then take action. Firstly for today and then for tomorrow. And Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who celebrated her 17th birthday on Friday, lent her support to ongoing protests in Australia, retweeting the following: Climate Strike Sydney AustraliaWeek 17.Our country is literally on fire. People are dying, houses burning and flora and fauna being devastated. What will it take for world leaders to wake up and act?#FridaysForFuture @GretaThunberg @fff_Sydney #ClimateEmergency #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/9NWR7GbY2F On Channel Seven’s Sunrise program on Saturday morning, television presenter and author Gretel Killeen accused Scott Morrison of failing to take responsibility for climate change and called for him to resign.
