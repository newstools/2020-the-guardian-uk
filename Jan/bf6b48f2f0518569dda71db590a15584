The first Monday after New Year’s Day has come to be known as ‘Divorce day’ as this is the day lawyers often see a spike in enquiries from people wanting to end their marriages. Last year, UK provider of relationship support Relate, reported a rise in searches to its website over the Christmas period and in the first few weeks of January as couples sought relationship counselling. As horrible a process as divorce can be, sometimes it leads to ex-couples becoming better friends than they were during their marriage. If you’ve ever been divorced and it had a positive impact on your relationship with your ex-partner we’d like to hear from you. We are also keen to hear from people who specifically enquired about getting a divorce in January this year or in previous years. Did you become better friends with your ex-partner after you divorced? What positive impact did getting a divorce have on your relationship with your ex-partner, your single life and your mental health? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below.
