I was sad to read in his column last week that Gary Younge will be leaving the Guardian. I’ve enjoyed his work over his years at the paper, which I always found informative, entertaining and thought-provoking, and I will miss his writing. His series of dispatches from the American south a few years ago was especially timely; his ongoing warnings and coverage of the dangers posed by racism, intolerance and prejudice has proved to be increasingly important, as over the last five years we’ve seen these topics drive a wedge through societies at home and abroad. His parting words in his last column summed up our current situation, advocated resistance in the face of adversity, and will, I hope, prove inspirational to others: “The propensity to despair is strong, but should not be indulged. Sing yourself up. Imagine a world in which you might thrive, for which there is no evidence. And then fight for it.” Powerful words from a great journalist. I wish him well in his new position as professor of sociology at Manchester University, and hope to read more of his work in the future.David PurvisSpittal, Northumberland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
