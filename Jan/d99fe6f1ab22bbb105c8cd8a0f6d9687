Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I want to get fit this year, but money is tight (understatement) and I don’t want to join a gym. I’m thinking of walking or running to work (it would take me about 75 minutes to walk there), or would cycling be better? What are the best ways to get fit with minimal expenditure? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
