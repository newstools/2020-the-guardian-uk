Macclesfield Town manager Daryl McMahon and his assistant Steve Gritt have resigned from their roles at the League Two club. The pair are understood to have been frustrated at the club’s crippling financial situation, with players and first-team staff paid late on numerous occasions in recent months, as well as a lack of resources. It is understood the December pay also arrived late. Macclesfield were deducted six points in December after breaching several EFL regulations and a further four-point deduction has been suspended after the club pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including the non-payment of salaries at an independent disciplinary commission hearing and the failure to play against Crewe last month, when Macclesfield’s players cited concerns over their emotional wellbeing. The commission, appointed in accordance with EFL regulations, came to the decision after hearing representations from both the EFL and Macclesfield, believing the punishment sufficient for “the aggravating and mitigating factors of the case”. That points deduction followed a judge at the Insolvency and Companies Court in London, Sally Barber, adjourning a bid to wind up the club until 15 January over a claim of unpaid tax. Judges have been told that Macclesfield bosses owed a “very large” amount of tax and owed former manager Sol Campbell more than £180,000. McMahon won four of his 25 games in charge since being appointed as Sol Campbell’s successor in August. McMahon previously managed Ebbsfleet, while Gritt previously had spells at Charlton and Brighton. The Macclesfield owner Amar Alkhadi said the club plan to publish a statement regarding McMahon on Thursday afternoon.
