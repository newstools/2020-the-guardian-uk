Saracens have announced that Nigel Wray will retire as club chairman with immediate effect. The reigning Premiership champions received a 35-point deduction and were fined more than £5m in November for breaching league salary cap regulations. Saracens say that a new independent chairman will be “appointed imminently”. In the meantime, Edward Griffiths will take up the role of interim chief executive for a 12-month period and Mitesh Velani will assume a consultancy position at Saracens and remain on their board. In a statement on their website, the 71-year-old Wray said: “As we enter a new year, a new decade, it is time for the club to make a fresh start. I am not getting any younger and feel this is the right moment for me to stand down as chairman and just enjoy being a fan of this incredible rugby club. I will always be committed to the wonderful Saracens family. “The Wray family will continue to provide the required financial support to the club, and I will remain actively engaged in the work of the Saracens Sport Foundation and Saracens High School, as part of the Club’s ongoing commitment to our community in north London.” Wray has provided financial backing for Saracens throughout the sport’s 25-year professional era. His tenure also saw a level of sustained success on domestic and European stages. Saracens, though, are battling to stay in the top flight this term following the points deduction for breaching salary cap regulations in the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons by failing to disclose payments to players. They are currently bottom of the table, 18 points behind 11th-placed Leicester.
