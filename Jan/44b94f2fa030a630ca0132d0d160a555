The controversial rightwing commentator Katie Hopkins has had her Twitter account suspended for violating the terms of the social media site. Hopkins’ account was still visible online on Thursday night, but Twitter said that Hopkins had been temporarily locked out of the platform for violating its anti-hate policy. A spokesperson for Twitter told the BBC that it was looking into complaints from anti-racism campaigners that Hopkins’ comments on the social media platform constituted hate speech. “Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us – abuse and harassment have no place on the service,” said the spokesperson, according the BBC. “These rules apply to everyone using our service – regardless of the account involved.” Hopkins, who rose to prominence as a contestant on the Apprentice, is known for her outspoken views. She regularly tweets pro-Trump, pro-Brexit and anti-immigration messages and has launched a series of attacks on the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. She has received a boost in Twitter follower numbers after being retweeted several times by US president. Hopkins describes herself in her Twitter bio as “Milo’s Mum. The Female Farage. Angry Ellen de Generes. The Biggest Bitch in Britain.” She has more than one million Twitter followers.
