Your article’s description of a property in Southwater (Fantasy house hunt, 18 January) may give the impression that Berkeley Homes benevolently provided the facilities mentioned as new to the village. In fact, the sports and social club, including the cricket pavilion, cricket and football pitches and playground, had been in existence for many years. However, as part of their massive housing development encompassed all the land they were on, they simply replaced the existing buildings and facilities further up the hill on the edge of an unremarkable estate.G ButlerSouthwater, West Sussex • Thank you for a marvellously readable Journal on Thursday: Owen Jones on crime, punishment and rehabilitation; Martin Kettle on Brexit; Suzanne Moore; a wonderful obituary on Terry Jones by Stuart Jeffries; a long-overdue long read on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe by Patrick Wintour. And I haven’t even mentioned the letters page. Worth every penny of my subscription.Jan JeffriesBrewood, Staffordshire • Plenty of marmalade still hanging around then (Letters, 21 January). My 95-year-old wife has had me (90) slicing orange peel for the last three hours, and we’ve still some left on the shelf from last year’s batch. So why make 18 jars more? Answer: to give away. Marmalade is a wonderful gift for the friend who has everything.W Paul WilkinsonAtherstone, Warwickshire • A three-word solution to weekend loneliness (G2, 16 January): join the Ramblers. There are short, easy walks as well as long hikes.Elaine SteaneOxford • I would like to assure Tony Green (Letters, 23 January) that not one of the many friends I meet at my church every Sunday is imaginary.Lesley BarnesGreenford, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
