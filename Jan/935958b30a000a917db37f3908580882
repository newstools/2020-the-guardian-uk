Tottenham have agreed a fee of €30m (£25.4m) for the PSV Eindhoven winger Steven Bergwijn, plus €2m in add-ons, which are believed to be easily achievable, with the player set to undertake his medical and put the finishing touches to the transfer. Toon Gerbrands, the PSV general manager, has confirmed that the deal is in place, having been struck at midnight on Monday, and the Dutch club now hope to prise Patrick van Aanholt from Crystal Palace. They have made an offer of €7m for the left-sided player. Bergwijn, 22, is best known for playing off the left, although he can play as a No 10, and his imminent arrival will fire the youthful rebuild in train at Spurs. The club signed four young players last summer – Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso (both 23), Ryan Sessegnon and Jack Clarke (both 19) – and they have taken the 21-year-old midfielder Gedson Fernandes from Benfica on an 18-month loan this month. Clarke is on loan at Queens Park Rangers. Bergwijn, a strong candidate to start for the Netherlands at Euro 2020, has been signed to offset the €20m departure of Christian Eriksen to Internazionale, which is close to being completed, although the pair have different skill sets. Bergwijn caused a stir on Sunday when he made a phone call to the PSV interim manager, Ernest Faber, to discuss his desire to join Spurs and was promptly stood down from the team that drew 1-1 at home to FC Twente. Bergwijn, who travelled to London later that day, used Instagram to state that he had not refused to play against FC Twente. Spurs have not yet managed a breakthrough with Real Sociedad over a fee for the striker Willian José but remain in talks with Milan over a possible deal for another forward, Krzysztof Piatek. Tottenham have proposed an 18-month loan for Piatek with an option to buy but that has been rejected.
