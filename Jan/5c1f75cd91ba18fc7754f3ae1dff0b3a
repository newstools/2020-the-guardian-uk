French police have clashed with firefighters protesting in Paris against their working conditions and demanding more pay. Thousands of firefighters attended the demonstration in the French capital, asking for an increase in their hazard bonus, which has not changed since 1990. Riot police fired teargas and used batons against some protesters. In October, firefighters also demonstrated in Paris, calling for better pay, guarantees for their pension benefits and greater respect for their profession. There has been widespread labour unrest across France since December, with unions mobilising against President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s plans to reform the pension system.
