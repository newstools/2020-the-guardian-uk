Damian Lillard set a franchise record with 61 points, including a career-best 11 three-pointers, and the short-handed Portland Trail Blazers outlasted the equally depleted Golden State Warriors 129-124 in overtime on Monday night. Lillard’s previous career high was 60 points earlier this season against Brooklyn. His 11 3-pointers were also a team record. “I guess if somebody’s going to beat my record, it’s good to be me,” Lillard said after the game. It was the seventh regular-season game of Lillard’s career with more than 50 points. He also had 10 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season. Elsewhere, Kemba Walker scored 20 points to end a career-long personal losing streak against LeBron James, and Jayson Tatum scored 27 to help Boston send the top team in the Western Conference to their biggest loss of the season. Jaylen Brown scored 20 points, drawing a taunting technical after dunking over James, and Enes Kanter had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Boston. “I ain’t going to lie, that was pretty nice, pretty awesome,” Brown said. “LeBron, he’s gotten so many other guys. Just to be out there against one of the best players to ever play the game is an honor. I always like like that matchup and it gives me a little extra boost.” James said there was no shame in getting beaten this time. “Why would I take it personally? It’s part of basketball,” he said. “It’s not the first time I got dunked on. It might not be the last time I get dunked on. But Jaylen’s been playing exceptionally well this year. It was a good play.” James had 15 points and 13 assists for the Lakers, who had won 10 of their previous 11 games. But the Celtics made 13 of their first 22 three-point attempts to open 103-75 lead in the third quarter the biggest against Los Angeles all season until Boston made it a 34-point game in the fourth.
