West Ham fear they will miss out on Gedson Fernandes to Tottenham after learning that the Benfica midfielder has been offered to their fierce London rivals. West Ham want to sign Fernandes on an initial 18-month loan but the latest twist in a complicated saga has seen Spurs enter the race after being contacted by Jorge Mendes, the player’s new agent. It is understood that Mendes, who has historical links with José Mourinho, has recently started representing the Portugal international. West Ham have held talks with Benfica over a deal for Fernandes this week and made a fresh proposal to the Portuguese side on Thursday. It is understood that reports of the transfer being agreed in principle are incorrect. Spurs are in the midst of an injury crisis and may view the offer to sign Fernandes as an opportunity worth taking. Mourinho wants to sign Milan’s Piatek after losing Harry Kane to a hamstring injury until April and he needs reinforcements in midfield, with Moussa Sissoko also out until April following knee surgery. Fernandes, who can play in central midfield or on the right, could give Spurs an easy way of bolstering the depth of their squad. Fernandes is regarded as a long-term prospect by David Moyes, West Ham’s manager. The 21-year-old, who has also been linked with Everton, Lyon and Manchester United, would not be expected to make an immediate impact. It is believed that Fernandes has family in London and is open to moving to the city. However it remains to be seen whether Spurs firm up their interest or leave the path free for West Ham. West Ham will not consider their January business done if they sign Fernandes. Moyes is considering a move for Stoke’s Joe Allen and the club also hold an interest in another midfielder, Genk’s Sander Berge.
