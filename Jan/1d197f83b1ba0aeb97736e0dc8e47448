West Ham have underlined their determination not to lose their best young players after agreeing a deal with Conor Coventry, who was out of contract out in the summer and a target for a number of clubs this month. The 19-year-old is expected to sign a three and a half year deal that contains an option of a one-year extension. Talks with Coventry have been going on since the start of the season and West Ham had grown concerned they would lose the midfielder, with clubs in the Championship and abroad expressing an interest. Frustration had mounted on both sides of the negotiating table and the standoff had raised the prospect of West Ham being forced to cash in on one of their most promising youngsters or risk him signing a pre-contract with a foreign side before departing in the summer. Coventry, who has made two substitute appearances for West Ham in the League Cup and been included on the bench for a handful of Premier League games, is now likely to be loaned out to gain experience for the rest of the season. A move to a League One side seen as his best chance of playing regularly. The teenager, who has been at West Ham since he was 10, is a Republic of Ireland Under-21 international and displayed his potential when he was named man of the match in a 0-0 draw against Italy last October. West Ham are unlikely to recall Grady Diangana from his loan spell at West Brom this month. The winger has excelled for West Brom, who are chasing automatic promotion to the Premier League, and there is a feeling on all sides that the 21-year-old is benefiting from playing regularly. It is thought that David Moyes, who replaced Manuel Pellegrini as West Hamâ€™s manager last weekend, will bring Diangana back only if he loses players to injury or suffers a run of defeats before the window shuts.
