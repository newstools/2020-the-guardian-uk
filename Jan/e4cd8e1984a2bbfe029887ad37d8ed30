I read with interest your leader (Disappointment at this week’s Bafta nominees could be spur for renewal, Journal, 11 January). At the core of the issue is the domination of US studios and distributors in what you call the “British film industry”. Pinewood and Shepperton have 10-year deals with Disney and Netflix, Warner Bros has its Leavesden base, and Technicolor owns large slabs of our post-production industry. Even the BFI’s chair is head of Warner Bros Entertainment UK, Ireland and Spain. Nearly all UK multiplexes are US-owned, so is it any surprise that US-owned films get a lot of promotion in the UK during the awards season? As a Bafta and US Academy member, I get deluged with DVD screeners in the run-up to Christmas. Where does one start? The tendency is to start with titles I’ve heard of, often the films with large promotional budgets, with paid-for adverts and editorial all over the trade press. With inevitable pressure on time, do the smaller, perhaps more interesting, films get a look in? Sometimes. This might explain the results this year, and most years, favouring the high-budget, US-produced films. Although the major studios employ many highly skilled British and European craftsmen, the UK is to Hollywood what China is to Silicon Valley: a beneficial location to outsource production, with the bonus in the UK of substantial tax incentives. This is what a US trade deal can look like in practice. David Puttnam covers the topic well in his book The Undeclared War: The Struggle for Control of the World’s Film Industry. Can we even consider there to be an indigenous British film industry of any substance?David SproxtonBristol • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
