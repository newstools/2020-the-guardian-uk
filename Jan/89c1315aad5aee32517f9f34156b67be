Laura Graves, an Olympic bronze medalist and the United States’ top podium contender in dressage for 2020, will miss the Tokyo Games after announcing the retirement of her mount Verdades. “With the retirement of my longtime partner, Verdades (Diddy), it will no longer be possible for me to pursue a place on the team that will represent the United States in Tokyo,” Graves said in a statement issued on Friday through US Equestrian. “This decision was not taken lightly, but was made in Verdades’ best interests.” The 32-year-old former bartender and cosmetologist from Vermont and the 18-year-old Dutch Warmblood have been staples on the US team since bursting from obscurity in 2014, when they came in fifth in the Grand Prix freestyle at the world equestrian games and second at the Grand Prix national championship behind three-time Olympian Steffen Peters and Legolas. Results like those propelled the duo from outside the top 700 to 10th in the FEI world rankings in less than 18 months. The pair earned team gold and individual silver at the 2015 Pan American Games, before anchoring the United States team to bronze at the Rio Olympics, which equalled the nation’s best finish in dressage since 1948, while just missing the podium in the individual event with a fourth-place finish. “It is with both a heavy heart and a grateful mind that today, I announce the retirement of my great friend, Diddy,” Graves wrote Thursday on Instagram. “I’ve always promised that I would do my best to listen and make the right choice for him when this time came. It became clear in recent weeks that he was not going to be able to return to his usual top form in 2020.” It is with both a heavy heart and a grateful mind that today, I announce the retirement of my great friend, Diddy. I've always promised that I would do my best to listen and make the right choice for him when this time came. It became clear in recent weeks that he was not going to be able to return to his usual top form in 2020. While nothing makes me happier than watching him play in his field and take him for hacks, it is still a very new and very sad realization for me that this journey has reached its end. This horse not only achieved every goal we ever set, but he fulfilled dreams that I never knew I had. Not always the easiest, it was his generous heart and incredible sense of loyalty that made him one of a kind. Every time I sit in his saddle, I continue to feel honored and humble that he allowed me to be his person. We have travelled the world together, many times over and cut our teeth at some the world's greatest competitions. While it will not be the same loading up the trailer without him, I am very much looking forward to the next chapter of my career with a stable full of young horses. I would like to express a deep love and appreciation for so many people, without whom, this horse would never had made his way to the world stage. My family, especially my mom, who selected Diddy with her keen eye and supported us even when everyone said we were crazy. My soon to be husband, Curt who is always my biggest fan and never questions my need to care for our animals. Debbie McDonald who gave us time when no one else would and believed in our ability to be great. Betsy Juliano who has been by my side through the ups and downs of this rollercoaster and made so much possible for me. Emmalie Clapp my amazing groom who always cares for my horses like her own. Our talented and dedicated team of veterinarians and farriers who kept this boy in top shape for so many years. Robert Dover, Hallye Griffin, US Equestrian and the USET for giving us the opportunity to represent the USA. Lastly, the biggest thank you to Verdades, Diddy, Diddyman, Bugs, my buddy for the joy you have brought to so many. A post shared by  Laura Graves (@lauragravesdressage) on Jan 8, 2020 at 10:34am PST Graves’ love of horses was kindled when she was a toddler and her parents traded in a washing machine and a tumble-dryer for the two ponies they had been boarding for a family friend. She dreamed of competing in dressage from a young age, but was limited to 4H events and lower-level competitions around New England due to lack of funding. The family purchased Verdades on a modest budget sight unseen from a sales video when Graves was 15, but the six-month-old foal was bad-tempered and often would refuse to be ridden. Falls were common, including one that left Graves with a broken back. “We tried, unsuccessfully, to sell him,” she told CNN in 2016. “He was just extremely wild and temperamental, to the point where he was dangerous because he was so explosive. Not ever mean, but not controllable. “Some days I would say, ‘OK, I just can’t ride him today. He’s not rideable.’ Until he was seven years old I couldn’t get a mounting block close to him, I just had to climb up. “It was all so honest. You couldn’t be angry with him. But it felt like an awful lot of defeat.” Graves refused to give up. She abandoned her hairdressing career and relocated to Florida, bringing Diddy through the levels herself, an uncommon practice at the elite level. The pair continued to shine after their Olympic moment, winning double silver at the 2018 World Equestrian Games to become the first American partnership to reach No 1 in the world rankings. 🥂 Cheers to 🌎 World #1 @LGravesDressage and Verdades 🙌 pic.twitter.com/El9QXFAPak “This horse not only achieved every goal we ever set, but he fulfilled dreams that I never knew I had,” Graves said on Thursday. “Not always the easiest, it was his generous heart and incredible sense of loyalty that made him one of a kind.

The third-ranked American in the current rankings, excluding Graves, is 61-year-old Shelly Francis, who if chosen would become the oldest US Olympian in any sport outside the art competitions since 1904, according to NBC Sports.
