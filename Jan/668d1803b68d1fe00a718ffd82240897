Fresh from a lightning quick victory over Donald Cerrone in his UFC comeback, Conor McGregor has praised the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump marked Martin Luther King Day on Monday by using Twitter to hail his own achievements in reducing unemployment among African Americans. McGregor responded: “Phenomenal President. Quite possibly the USA goat [greatest of all time]. Most certainly one of them anyway, as he sits atop the shoulders of many amazing giants that came before him.” In 2016, Trump polled 6% among black voters. Phenomenal President. Quite possibly the USA 🐐. Most certainly one of them anyway, as he sits atop the shoulders of many amazing giants that came before him. No easy feet.Early stages of term also.Incredible.Congrats and Happy Martin Luther King Jr. day America 🇺🇸❤️🇮🇪 McGregor said he looked forward to Trump’s future achievements. “Early stages of term also,” he wrote. Trump has a quarter of his first term to serve, though victory at the polls in November would keep him in office until 2024. The Irishman’s views are not a surprise. In a 2017 interview with GQ, he criticised anti-Trump protests in New York City. He also has plenty in common with UFC president Dana White, who backed Trump for president in a bombastic speech at the 2016 Republican national convention. “Trump is a fighter and I know he will fight for this country,” White told the crowd in Cleveland. Zuffa, the then parent company of the UFC, contributed $500,000 to Trump’s 2016 campaign. McGregor took just 40 seconds to win Saturday’s bout with Cerrone, his first victory since November 2016.
