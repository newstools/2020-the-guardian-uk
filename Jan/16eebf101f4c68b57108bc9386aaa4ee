So the government believes that EU citizens do not need physical proof of their right to reside in the UK on the grounds that cards can be “lost, stolen or tampered with” (Landlords back cards for EU citizens to prove post-Brexit status, 22 January).

Joined-up thinking?James WilkinsonFord, Shropshire • American and Aussie English are often at odds (Letters, 21 January). When I taught in a Queensland high school my American colleague Mary-Ellen once caused outrage when she asked a group of senior girls, practising cheerleading on the school oval, which of the local footie teams they rooted for. We had to explain that “root” is the Aussie F-word.Clive CollinsMartlesham Heath, Suffolk • What a wonderful gift Terry Jones possessed, to be able to make us laugh so much (Obituaries, 23 January). Seeing the “naughty boy” clip had me laughing more than I’ve done for ages – 31 January would be the ideal time for some Monty Python repeats.Helen EvansRuthin, Denbighshire • A heartfelt endorsement, from this 85-year-old, of Adrian Brodkin’s plea for jam tomorrow, or at least this year (Letters, 23 January). Our damson tree usually provides fruit for up to 40lb of jam, but last year not a single damson.Betty Clarke Malvern, Worcestershire • Jam tomorrow? I thought that was the Conservative manifesto.Irene JonesBroxted, Essex • Disappointing photo of five Labour leadership candidates with Zoe Williams’ piece – the focus is literally on the only man (Journal, 22 January).John D McKinleyKillinchy, County Down • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
