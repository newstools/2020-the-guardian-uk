Giles Mercer (Letters, 10 January) says the late Fr Ben O’Rourke taught English “brilliantly”, which is true. He got us reading extensively off the syllabus by supplying long summer reading lists. These included Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment and Sartre’s Nausea. Novels of adultery, guilt and terror, and existential anguish – a remarkably open-minded list for a Catholic priest in the 60s.Neil CorcoranEmeritus professor of English literature, Liverpool University • In the 50s I experienced flavoured crisps (G2, 14 January) in Burton upon Trent. They were made by the Bass Brewery as a side product of the yeast used in the brewing process. I think they were called Marmite crisps. I could only buy them in Burton, where I went to stay with my grandparents.Hazel AndersonAbergavenny, Monmouthshire • Congratulations to Mr and Mrs Swann (Letters, 13 January) on their optimism in making marmalade at the ages of 77 and 78. I, too, have just made 18lb. I live on my own and shall be 84 next month. Hope triumphant?David HitchinWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire • Years ago an elderly friend returned from a medical consultation with the very melancholy news that we all must face. He said he’d been advised not to buy any long-playing records.Allan CheethamRomford, London • Deducing that Friday’s Wordwheel answer was probably BrexitDone made me very grumpy. Monday’s paper revealed that it was actually TinderBox. Meh. Same difference. Rosemary JohnsonLondon • My daughter and son-in-law moved to Canada last year. They are happy and productive. Just saying (Harry and Meghan get Queen’s backing, 14 January).Lynda AndrewsMarch, Cambridgeshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
