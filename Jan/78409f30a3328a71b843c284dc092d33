Eni Aluko has been appointed sporting director for Aston Villa Women. The former England striker takes up the post with the Championship leaders a week after announcing she was ending her playing career. “I feel it’s something that I’m ready for at this point in my career,” said Aluko. “I’ve always been passionate about the women’s game, its development and setting cultures that drive excellence. “I’ll be helping to create a successful club in Aston Villa Women, and obviously I’m back home in Birmingham where it all started for me. I’m excited for this next step.” Villa’s CEO, Christian Purslow, added: “Eniola enjoyed a fabulous playing career and took her first steps in the game in this city, the city where she grew up. She is an inspiration and inspiring role model to young girls and women in Birmingham and will help Aston Villa to be an exemplar of women’s and girl’s football in the region.” The former England striker left Juventus in November and announced last week that she had played her last game as a professional player. “I very much feel like I’m ending on a high, with a sense that there’s not much more I can do in the game,” she told the Guardian. “There is nothing that could motivate me to keep playing for another two or three years aside from a love of the game, which is something I can express through other avenues.” She is considered one of England’s greatest players, winning 102 international caps, playing at three World Cups and two European Championships, as well as representing Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics.
