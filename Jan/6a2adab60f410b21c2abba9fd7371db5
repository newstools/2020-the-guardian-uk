I have a 25-year-old son, the younger of two. I believe he is addicted to cannabis, which he says he needs to combat his anxiety. He doesn’t work and has episodes of rage. I help him as much as I can financially without physically handing him cash. When I can’t help him, he turns on me. He threatens me, saying things such as: “I don’t want to live any more,” which keeps me awake at night. I feel so sad and scared to enjoy myself because he is so unhappy. I am at a loss. I just don’t know what to do. • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
