Port Vale striker Tom Pope gained attention this weekend for scoring against Manchester City but could now be subject to an investigation by the Football Association after posting a series of tweets linking the Rothschilds to “every bank on the planet.” When asked by a fan to “predict the World War III result” Pope tweeted “We invade Iran then Cuba then North Korea then the Rothschilds are crowned champions of every bank on the planet.” When another Twitter user highlighted why the FA might want to investigate a potentially anti-semitic remark, Pope continued to defend himself. “How is it racist??” he replied. “Seriously is someone out to destroy me or what? Someone asked how does WW3 end and I replied when said countries were invaded and they have all the banks!! What’s the problem with that? Seriously?? In another post, he tweeted: “They own the bloody banks! There’s no racial malice whatsoever and anyone would say the bloody same! I didn’t choose a side I merely stated they own the banks and that’s it!” It is understood the FA are looking into the matter and could launch an investigation depending on the outcome of talks with both the player and his club. Pope had drawn special attention before Port Vale’s FA Cup tie with Manchester City for tweeting last year that he would score 40 goals a season if he faced John Stones every week, and duly scored Port Vale’s solitary goal at the Etihad, leading to a frosty post-match meeting in the home dressing room between Pope and the England defender. “They all dragged me in, the Man City players, but John wouldn’t speak to me,” said Pope, whose goal was also his 109th for the club, a post-war record. “It was a little bit awkward. I shook his hand but he wasn’t too happy.” Pope certainly felt he had no reason to back down, later tweeting: “I’d just like to say I was completely wrong and bang out of order to say I’d score 40 a season..... it’s more like 50.” All eyes were on their duel and, although Stones largely dealt with him well and had the last laugh as City prevailed, Pope certainly had his moment. Sorry I can’t reply to everyone it’s gone mental! I’d just like to say I was completely wrong and bang out of order to say I’d score 40 a season..... it’s more like 50 😊😊😊 enjoy your weekend 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Pope cancelled out Oleksandr Zinchenko’s opener with a fine header and later intercepted a Stones pass to create another chance. Pope said: “It was only banter and people have dug it up because we’ve drawn Man City. All of a sudden it’s everywhere and people have been on my case about it. [Stones’] is a world-class centre-half. I was just saying he wasn’t very physical and that’s it. If people think I’m wrong, well, I don’t care. “I spoke to (Benjamin) Mendy and he said all their players had battered him for weeks about it and they got him that wound up about it, and then obviously I’ve scored and he’s probably devastated. “But I was just hoping I got a half chance to try to put one away. The last thing you want to do is get beaten 7-0 after everything that’s gone on Twitter, not score and everyone laugh. It was nice to shut a few people up to back up what I said but it’s water off a duck’s back. I wasn’t too bothered about it either way.” Despite Pope’s 34th-minute leveller, City never really looked like relinquishing their grip on the FA Cup. Sergio Agüero restored the lead before the break and Taylor Harwood-Bellis got the final touch on a Stones shot to claim City’s third. Phil Foden wrapped up the scoring but Vale still left with credit. Pope said: “Beforehand we were all joking we would take five and we ended up conceding four, so that’s an added bonus for us. Pep (Guardiola) put a ridiculous side out and as soon as you seen the team sheet, that’s when you start to shake. But the lads dug in and worked their socks off.”
