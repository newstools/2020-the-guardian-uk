 The British and Irish governments have handed Northern Ireland’s political parties a draft agreement designed to restore devolution and pressurise them to accept a compromise deal. The document shown to them on Thursday night contained promises of extra cash for the region if the parties would embrace their proposal. This week marked the third year since the devolved power sharing agreement collapsed. Sinn Féin withdrew from the regional government over the role of its main coalition partners, the Democratic Unionist party, in a controversial, botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions pounds. The Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said now was the “moment of truth”. Smith hinted during a press conference outside the Stormont parliament that there might be a compromise over a proposed Irish Language Act, a key demand by Sinn Féin before it goes back into the regional government with the DUP. Unionists have opposed a stand-alone Irish Language Act that would put Gaelic on par with English in the region. The secretary of state said there would be a “good balance dealing with that issue”. This suggests that an Irish Language Act would be coupled with legislation to protect Ulster Protestant culture. Irish deputy prime minister Tánaiste Simon Coveney also used the word “balance” to describe make-or-break issues including the Irish Language Act. The five parties involved in power-sharing – which also includes the centrist Alliance Party, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP– were presented with the document on Thursday night, but according to one political source at the talks it was “whipped away quickly” from their delegation before the two ministers faced the media. The two governments have imposed a deadline of next Monday before they say they will close the talks. Their move on Thursday night, without any actual final agreement between Sinn Fein and the DUP yet, is a calculated gamble to put pressure on the two big parties to reach a compromise.
