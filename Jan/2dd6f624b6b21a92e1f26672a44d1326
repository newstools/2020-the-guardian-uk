Would you recognize this man without his name tag? Close inspection of said name tag reveals that it belongs to none other than “Brad Pitt. Actor in a supporting role. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” You may also know him as Jennifer Aniston’s ex-husband. The name tag has drawn laughs from entertainment reporters all over the US media. “Hi, my name is Brad Pitt, in case you didn’t see the name tag,” said Francesca Bacardi, a Page Six reporter. “The extra T is silent,” joked Diane King Hall, a correspondent at CBS News. One might consider it the best display of humility in Hollywood history. After all, Leonardo DiCaprio didn’t wear a name tag. Margot Robbie didn’t wear a name tag. Greta Gerwig didn’t wear a name tag – which she obviously didn’t need to – but it should be noted that her career so far is about a third of the length of Pitt’s. Love that Brad Pitt wore a name tag at the Oscars Nomineee Luncheon today. pic.twitter.com/sFiPgRAeHW Still, here was Pitt, letting you know that he was once a minor actor in a movie. Cute. Maybe he has been nominated for enough Oscars (seven) that he doesn’t mind wearing a name tag, making coffee for everyone, or even grabbing lunch for the other actors when they are, like, really busy. Pitt has proven himself to be a bit of a joker in the past, so it could have been a prank. While making Ocean’s Twelve, Pitt reportedly notified the crew that his colleague George Clooney was not to be looked at, and that he should be referred to by his cast name, Danny Ocean, at all times. Clooney responded by putting bumper stickers on Pitt’s car in a feat of homophobic machismo – one read: “I’m gay and I vote”, the other “Small Penis on Board”.
