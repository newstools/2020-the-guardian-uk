Atlético Madrid pulled off a stunning turnaround to beat Barcelona 3-2 in an enthralling Spanish Super Cup tie in Saudi Arabia and book their place in the final of the revamped competition where they will face Real Madrid. Argentinian forward Ángel Correa’s winner in the 86th minute complete an unlikely late comeback for Atlético after Barça had dominated the second half and had two goals ruled out following VAR reviews. Substitute Koke had put Atlético in front at the start of the second half but Lionel Messi levelled in the 51st minute. Messi soon put the ball in the net again but his second effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR review. Former Atlético striker Antoine Griezmann did put Barça in front in the 65th minute while Gerard Piqué thought he had extended their lead moments later but that goal was also ruled out by a VAR review, this time for a fractional offside against Arturo Vidal. Atlético had spent most of the second half trying to stop waves of Barcelona attacks but received a lifeline when substitute Vitolo was tripped by goalkeeper Neto and striker Álvaro Morata equalised from the penalty spot in the 81st minute. Stand-in keeper Neto was also at fault for the winning goal, failing to properly block Correa’s shot which bounced in to seal the comeback.
