Patrick Cutrone is close to signing for Fiorentina only five months after joining Wolverhampton Wanderers from Milan for £16.2m. Fiorentina and Wolves have restarted negotiations to discuss a deal which would see the 22-year-old go on loan to Italy for 18 months, with an obligation to buy at the end of that time. The deal would be worth €18m (£15.3m), with €2m as a loan fee and the remaining €16m to be paid in the summer of 2021. The former Milan striker, who has one cap for Italy, has struggled to hold down a starting place at Molineux, making 12 Premier League appearances and scoring two goals. He has not completed 90 minutes once. Cutrone has played more minutes in the Europa League and Carabao Cup, but without doing enough to cement his place in the first team for the Premier League. Fiorentina are having a poor season and are 15th in Serie A after 18 games. Their top scorers are Dusan Vlahovic, Nikola Milenkovic, Erick Pulgar and Gaetano Castrovilli, each with three league goals this campaign, and they are desperate to increase their options up front. Cutrone had been with Milan since 2007 and had his breakthrough season in 2017-18 when he scored 10 Serie A goals in 28 appearances, ending the season with 18 goals from 46 games in all competitions. In March 2018 he played his one and only game for Italy so far, a 2-0 defeat against Argentina. He was less productive in the 2018-19 season but still managed nine goals in 43 games in all competitions, leading to the summer switch to Wolves. It now looks, however, as if his Premier League adventure is set to finish after just half a season.
