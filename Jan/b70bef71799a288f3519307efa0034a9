Ashleigh Barty has netted a national prize as she battles to become Australia’s first Open singles champion since 1978. The 23-year-old tennis star from Ipswich in Queensland has been named 2020 Young Australian of the Year. Barty has been inspirational as she climbed the ranks to become the world’s No 1 women’s singles player, as well as serving as the National Indigenous Tennis Ambassador for Tennis Australia. Due to her Melbourne Park campaign, Barty was unavailable to be in Canberra for the awards ceremony on Saturday, but instead 2002 Australian of the Year Pat Rafter presented it to her in an interview room at the Open. “All of my values that I’ve lived by and try to live by every single day, regardless of whether it’s in sport ... all come from mum and dad,” she said. “It’s about being humble and respectful, and giving it a crack - trying to be the best you can be, and that’s all you can ask of yourself.” Barty can focus exclusively on her pursuit of Australian Open singles glory, with French nemesis Kristina Mladenovic ending her doubles assault at Melbourne Park on Saturday. Mladenovic teamed with Hungary’s Timea Babos on Saturday to beat Barty and German Julia Goerges 7-5 6-4 in the second round. Barty and Goerges blew a 4-0 lead in the first set as Mladenovic returned to haunt the world No 1. Mladenovic upset the French Open champion in last year’s Fed Cup final, before powering France to the title with another victory with Caroline Garcia over Barty and Samantha Stosur in the deciding doubles rubber in Perth. Her doubles exit, though, might prove a blessing as Barty continues her quest to become Australia’s first Open singles champion since Chris O’Neil in 1978. The top seed faces an intriguing fourth-round return bout against Alison Riske on Sunday after the American had eliminated Barty last year at Wimbledon.
