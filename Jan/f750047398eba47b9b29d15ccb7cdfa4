Jack Clarke is putting the finishing touches to a loan move to Queens Park Rangers for the remainder of the season. The Tottenham winger spent the first half of the campaign on a loan-back deal at Leeds – from where Spurs signed him last summer for an initial fee of around £10m. It has been a tough season for the 19-year-old, who made only three appearances for Leeds – two as a starter in the EFL Cup; one as a substitute in the Championship. He was held back in part by the rule that says Championship clubs can only name five loanees in their match-day squads. Leeds have five other players on temporary deals and Clarke was often the odd man out. Spurs recalled him when the January window opened with a view to finding him a loan where he could feature more regularly and QPR who, coincidentally, face Leeds at Loftus Road on Saturday, have beaten off competition from other Championship clubs to get him. Spurs are poised to announce the loan signing of the midfielder, Gedson Fernandes, from Benfica. The 21-year-old, who has two Portugal caps, has completed his medical and will join on an 18-month deal, which could become permanent in the summer of 2021. Spurs are looking for a new striker to cover the long-term injury absence of Harry Kane and have opened talks with Milan over the Poland international, Krzysztof Piatak, who is rated at £30m. Spurs would like to take him on loan but Milan are adamant that it must be a permanent deal or nothing.
