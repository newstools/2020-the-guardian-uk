I was interested to read Nazia Parveen’s article on the Women’s Institute (Report, 30 December), and I applaud Manchester WI for its efforts to attract younger women. However, I do sense a rather dismissive attitude towards those of us who are “of a certain age”, and therefore typecast in the “fuddy-duddy” mode mentioned in the article. The WI is diverse, and gives women the opportunity to join and be involved in any way that suits them. My WI is composed of mainly retired ladies, aged up to 90-odd years. We have a variety of interest groups, outings and regular speakers on challenging topics. We welcome new members of any age and hope we can “make a difference” despite our grey hairs. May the WI go from strength to strength in all its forms, and continue inspiring women.Jean EmesRoyston, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
