What goes around comes around. An ice disc appears to be forming in the same Maine river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. It is taking shape. What shape you ask? That circular disk shape we are all rooting for. Go ice disk, go! #icedisk2020 #IceDisk pic.twitter.com/w107ctJHDi The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disc 2020 is making a run for it ... It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” Since the initial tweet it has posted several more photos, each showing the disc appearing to grow larger and more regular. The ice formation comes just about a year after a disc measuring about 90 metres across was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disc shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.
