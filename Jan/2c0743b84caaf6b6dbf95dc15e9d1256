Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put the outfit she wore at the Golden Globes awards on eBay to raise money for the bushfire relief effort in Australia. The writer and star of Fleabag won two awards at Sunday’s ceremony, to which she wore an outfit by the Australian designers Ralph & Russo. The starting bid stands at A$77,000 (£40,000), and the auction is due to end on 20 January. In a video shared on the official Twitter account for Fleabag, Waller-Bridge showed fans where celebrities had touched the outfit, including Tom Hanks when he shook her hand, Elton John giving her a hug and Olivia Colman resting her cheek on the shoulder. The James Bond star Ana de Armas and Killing Eve’s Jodie Comer are also said to have touched the tuxedo. Waller-Bridge said: “I’m very excited that this stunning, one-of-a-kind, couture tuxedo created by Australian geniuses Ralph & Russo will continue its journey by contributing to this urgent cause. “If money raised by its auction can help raise funds to fight the disaster in Australia, the future impact of this suit will be far greater than the luck it brought me and the Fleabag team at the Golden Globes last weekend.” The money raised will be donated to the Australian Red Cross’s disaster relief and recovery fund, the Wires Wildlife Rescue emergency fund and Wildlife Victoria. Waller-Bridge is the latest celebrity to pledge support for the bushfire relief effort. Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental group has given $3m (£2.3 million) and John, Chris Hemsworth and Pink have also donated.
