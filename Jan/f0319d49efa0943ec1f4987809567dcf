Paul Pogba has a different ankle injury to the one that initially ruled him out for a large part of the season. The Manchester United midfielder made a comeback with two substitute appearances against Newcastle and Watford but will now be out for at least another four weeks. Ole Gunnar Solskjær said: “Paul came back after a long spell out, played in two games, had a reaction, and couldn’t go to Burnley. He felt his ankle was sore, so we did a scan. It’s not the same injury, it’s a different injury.” Solskjær, whose side face Wolves at Molineux in the FA Cup on Saturday, went on to explain why he stated after Wednesday’s defeat at Arsenal it was Pogba’s “people” who had informed the club he was not available. “His people? As in when you consult your surgeon and the ones you trust, that’s maybe my bad English. You have people you trust and speak to. When I did my injuries [and had] loads of knee operations, I had my people in Norway and Sweden I spoke to. Paul has people he trusts and that’s more important. “When you get that scan, we speak to him, you [as the player] consult your own medical people as well like I did, when I did my operation. You want the best second opinion and the advice was to have it done. It’s not a major one and probably, as I said, three or four weeks.” Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard will miss the game against Wolves because of illness.
