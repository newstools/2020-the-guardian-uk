Inter Milan were held to a third successive 1-1 draw in Serie A after Radja Nainggolan, a player they loaned to Cagliari for this season, scored a second-half equaliser against his parent club on Sunday. The Belgian, who was told by Inter coach Antonio Conte that there was no place for him this season, drove in a low shot from outside the area which found the goal via a deflection to stun the San Siro in the 78th minute. Lautaro Martínez had headed Inter in front in the 29th minute from a cross by the debutant Ashley Young, a goal that was followed by furious protests from Cagliari players who claimed the Argentine forward had pushed his marker. There was a two-minute delay for a VAR check before the goal was confirmed. Martínez was sent off in stoppage time for his furious reaction after being given a yellow card for a foul, and had to be ushered away by teammates as he continued to remonstrate with the referee. Second-placed Inter have 48 points from 21 games, three behind Juventus, who travel to Napoli on Sunday night, and three ahead of third-placed Lazio who meet Roma earlier in the evening. In Spain, Atlético Madrid were held to a goalless draw at home to Leganés, a result that lifted the visitors off rock-bottom and left Diego Simeone’s side in fourth place, two points behind Sevilla and seven behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, who could go top with a draw at Eibar on Sunday night.
