Share your photos of what peace means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box. The closing date is Wednesday 15 January at 10am. We’ll publish our favourites in the New Review on Sunday 19 January. You can share your ‘peace’ pictures by filling out the form below. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
