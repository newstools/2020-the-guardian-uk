Aaron Rodgers connected with Davante Adams eight times for 160 yards and two touchdowns, Green Bayâ€™s spruced-up defense fended off a spirited Seattle rally, and the Packers held on for a 28-23 victory Sunday night to reach the NFC championship game for the third time in six years. Aaron Jones rushed for 62 yards and two first-half scores for the Packers, who will travel next weekend to take on top-seeded San Francisco. .@AaronRodgers12 ðŸŽ¯ @tae15adams! #SEAvsGB | #GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/8VsgtAViTQ Russell Wilson carried the Seahawks on yet another comeback, this time from a 21-3 halftime deficit, but the Packers forced a punt just before the two-minute warning on the second sack of the game by Preston Smith, Green Bayâ€™s fifth of the game. Zaâ€™Darius Smith, the other big-money free agent added to the defense last spring, had two sacks himself. Rodgers then pulled off a number of high pressure throws in the final minutes to guarantee victory for the Packers.
