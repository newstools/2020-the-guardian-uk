Chris Barker has been described as an “inspiration”, “loyal” and an “absolute gentleman” as tributes pour in for the former Cardiff and Barnsley defender, who has died at the age of 39. Sheffield-born Barker also represented the likes of Southend, QPR, Plymouth and Aldershot during a playing career that began in 1999 and spanned almost two decades. Barker moved into coaching towards the end of his playing days, including spending a brief spell as Aldershot’s caretaker manager in the 2014-15 season, and since 2017 he had been the under-18s manager at Forest Green Rovers. The League Two club confirmed his death in a statement on Thursday. “We’re all heartbroken to hear this news, which came as a shock to everybody. Our immediate thoughts are with his family and friends,” said Hannah Dingley, head of academy at Forest Green. “Barks was a strong, inspirational leader to our under 18s and a much loved colleague. We’ll be offering help and support to those at the club affected by the tragic news – particularly our young players, and ask that Chris’ family get some privacy at this challenging time.” Chris was great with our young players, and popular with all. Sad news. https://t.co/il0POVdjvs A South Wales police statement read: “Police can confirm the sudden death of a 39 year-old man who was discovered at his home address in the Cyncoed area of Cardiff at approximately 2pm on New Year’s Day.

He also had loan spells at Stoke and Colchester before continuing a playing career that finished in 2017 following player-coach stints with non-league clubs Hereford and Weston-super-Mare.
