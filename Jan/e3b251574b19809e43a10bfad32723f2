Adrian Chiles (G2, 9 January) says he is very grateful for the advice Benignus (Ben) O’Rourke gave him. Ben died last year, but anyone wishing to take advantage of his wisdom could read his book Finding Your Hidden Treasure, published by Darton Longman Todd. In the book Ben gives lots of advice on the value of sitting still for a while each day, and how to use this time.Rev Canon David Pettifor Warwick • Having been taught English (brilliantly) at school by Father Benignus O’Rourke and remained lifelong friends, I nodded and smiled at Adrian Chiles’ reminiscences of this wise and charismatic priest. For Ben the individual’s inner relationship with God came first and last: from this source everything else flowed or made sense (including the church). Ben read extraordinarily widely, especially modern English and Irish literature, always somehow absorbing the insights he gained into his inner faith-core.
