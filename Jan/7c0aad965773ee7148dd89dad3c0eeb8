South Africa’s state-owned rail operator has apologised after passengers were left stranded for more than a day on a train from Johannesburg to Cape Town. Shosholoza Meyl said the train, which departed on Sunday, was scheduled to arrive in Cape Town on Monday evening. It is now expected to arrive late on Tuesday. The rail operator blamed engine problems for the “unpleasant experience” and said a rescue train was delayed by maintenance work. Passengers described beginning to run out of food and the carriages starting to smell. Shosholoza Meyl said alternative transport had arrived to take the stranded passengers to their destinations. The 870-mile (1,400km) rail journey between the two cities is popular with tourists and usually takes about 20 hours. There have been a number of accidents and incidents on South African commuter trains in recent years, and some state-owned businesses have been struggling with problems including mismanagement, corruption and the faltering economy.
