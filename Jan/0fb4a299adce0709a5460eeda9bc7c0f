Hans Zimmer has been drafted in as a last-minute replacement to score the James Bond movie No Time to Die, less than three months before its release. He replaces Dan Romer, who departs due to creative differences with the film’s production company Eon Productions, Variety reports. Romer had scored previous projects by Bond director Cary Fukunaga, such as Beasts of No Nation and Maniac. The theme song, a key element of each Bond film, has not yet been announced. Zimmer is one of Hollywood’s most high-profile composers, celebrated for his scores for films such as Gladiator, The Da Vinci Code and the Pirates of the Caribbean series. He won an Oscar for his 1994 theme for The Lion King, though he is perhaps best known for his collaborations with Christoper Nolan on Inception, Interstellar, the Dark Knight movies and more. Last week, Quentin Tarantino said “you could define the decade by” Zimmer’s score for Nolan’s film Dunkirk. Zimmer has scored two more films approaching release: superhero sequel Wonder Woman 1984 and Denis Villeneuve’s remake of Dune. He recently announced a live tour of arenas across Europe in spring 2021. • No Time to Die is released on 2 April in the UK and 10 April in the US.
