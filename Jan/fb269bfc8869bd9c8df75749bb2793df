A Japanese former postal worker faces possible charges after police discovered he stockpiled a mountain of mail at his home, reportedly saying it was “too much bother” to deliver the items. The man was referred to prosecutors for allegedly violating postal law, a Kanagawa prefectural police spokesman told Agence France-Presse. Local media reported that the 61-year-old had about 24,000 undelivered items dating back to 2003 at his home in Kanagawa, near Tokyo. He reportedly told the police “it was too much bother to deliver them”. “I didn’t want my colleagues to think I was less capable than younger people,” he added. If convicted, the man faces a jail sentence of less than three years or fines of up to 500,000 yen (£3,400), the police spokesman said. Japan Post fired the man after the issue came to light late last year, and it apologised for the failure to deliver the items, pledging to ensure they reach their intended destinations.
