The Veterans Chase series is made for horses like Wild West Wind (3.00), who was never the fastest and had a fallow period in mid-career but has now, aged 11, dropped to an attractive rating. He can win the series final at Sandown for Tom George, who has landed a couple of significant prizes in the past fortnight. A couple of years back Wild West Wind won three of his first four starts over fences and was fancied for the Welsh Grand National but he fell while leading that big field and it may have left a mark, as nothing seemed to go right for him for a long time. His two runs this term showed renewed promise, including at Kelso, where the omission of the last two fences did not help. He can outrun odds of 16-1. Dark Flame, second in the voided London National, is feared most. 1.50 Sandown There is temptation in Darebin, three times a winner at this track, including in this race a year ago. He comes from the Gary Moore yard that is going well and could have a big day, with a dozen runners lined up. But Johnbb’s claims are hard to fault in view of the progress he had made over fences, shown when he scored over course and distance last month. 2.05 Wincanton The risk of bad behaviour has to be built into the price about Admiral’s Secret, who refused to race three times last year. But Alan Johns coaxed a decent effort out of him last month and the horse returns to a track that has produced two of his better efforts. 2.25 Sandown Having won the Tolworth twice in the past three years, Colin Tizzard has an excellent chance of doing so again with Fiddlerontheroof. His second to Thyme Hill in the Persian War now looks strong form and he can be excused his defeat on good going at Wincanton soon after. He was impressive when switched to heavy here last month and a similar effort will make him hard to beat. However, Gavin Cromwell’s runners must always be respected and his Jeremys Flame has more to offer than we have seen so far. 2.40 Wincanton Nine is quite an age at which to be making your handicap debut but Horse Force One evidently had his problems after two bumper wins in 2017. His second hurdles run, in October, was encouraging and his rating looks beatable, with this step back up in distance to help. 3.15 Wincanton Philip Hobbs, trainer of Horse Force One, could be on the mark again with Gala Ball, who has a decent record in small-field races. This marks a return to calmer waters after the hot Newbury handicap in which he was well beaten in November. 3.35 Sandown Nico De Boinville may be able to win the race named after his blog, thanks to Gunnery. Useful on the Flat, the chestnut achieved his best run yet over hurdles when scoring by 12 lengths at Doncaster just before New Year. Has he recovered from that effort in just six days? If so, he will be very hard to beat under a 6lb penalty.
