The age of 47.2 has been discovered to be when people experience peak misery according to a study. David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, analysed data relating to wellbeing and age across 132 countries. He found that the average age of people living in developed nations were most unhappy at 47.2-years-old. We want to hear from anyone who is 47 or remembers what their wellbeing was like at that age. Were things better or worse beforehand? Did you find yourself becoming happier as you grew older? How did your unhappiness manifest at that age? For example, did you experience baldness or stress?
