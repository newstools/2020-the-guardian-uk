The futurologist Li Edelkoort (G2, 8 January) has predicted, among other things, that the libraries of the future will be “epicentres in small towns and villages ... which provide lectures and courses, exhibitions and concerts, and lend clothes”. In her view libraries will be one of the ways of addressing our dangerous social disconnection. Libraries Unlimited, a social enterprise and charity, is already doing some of this in Devon. Through working with a local homelessness charity, we have coats and jackets for people who need them. We provide author talks, film screenings, exhibitions, fun palaces and arts events, and our friends groups run a wide range of community events, quizzes and craft workshops. We still also, of course, lend lots of books.Sue SimmonsCommunity trustee, Libraries Unlimited • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
