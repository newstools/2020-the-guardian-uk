Aston Villa’s Tom Heaton and Wesley have been ruled out for the rest of the season. Wesley, the club’s £22m record signing, and goalkeeper Heaton sustained serious knee injuries during the 2-1 New Year’s Day win at Burnley. They had scans on Thursday when Villa’s worst fears were realised and Heaton is certain to miss England’s Euro 2020 campaign in the summer. In a club statement, Villa said: “Both players have suffered knee ligament damage. Heaton and Wesley were both in their first seasons as Villa players, following their summer arrivals from Burnley and Club Brugge respectively. “Club record signing Wesley scored six goals in 22 appearances in all competitions and earned himself a call-up to the Brazil squad. Meanwhile, Heaton has missed only one Premier League game this season, making 20 appearances. We would like to wish both players well as they begin their recovery.” Dean Smith and the club’s chief executive, Christian Purslow, will sit down on Friday with the sporting director, Suso, to discuss January signings. “We’ve got business planned, that’ll continue. I’m sitting down tonight with Christian and Suso to see what this changes for us. It’ll hasten what we do in the market,” Smith said. “The recruitment side won’t change from what we were looking at before.”
