The bill for the HS2 high-speed rail link could soar to £106bn, according to a government review that will raise further concerns about the controversial project. The unpublished report warns there is a “considerable risk” that costs could rise by another 20% compared with the last estimate, which priced the project at about £81bn to 88bn. The original budget for HS2 was £34bn. The report, seen by the Financial Times, has also called for work on the link from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds to be put on hold for six months to explore whether it could be made up of a mix of standard and high-speed rail. While the review, led by the former HS2 chairman Doug Oakervee, recommends that ministers should push ahead with HS2, it says further work is needed to assess what impact on growth the project will have in the regions as it is “hard” to determine whether there will be any economic benefits. “Transport investment alone will not ‘rebalance’ the UK economy,” the report said. The first leg of the project, linking London Euston to Birmingham, was due to open by the end of 2026 but a separate report by HS2 has said that could be pushed back until 2031. The second phase, linking Leeds and Manchester, was last expected to open in 2032-33, but the unpublished review claims this will open seven years later, in 2040. In November, the deputy chairman of the review, Lord Berkeley, demanded his name be struck from the report, due to its support for the project. He said parliament was seriously misled by “fiddled” figures about the true cost of HS2, which he said has spiralled “completely out of control”. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, last week said he had questions about the draft report, adding that a decision about the project would be made soon. The National Audit Office is expected to publish its own report on HS2 by the end of January.
