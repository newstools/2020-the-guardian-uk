Richard Burgon MP says Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity rating was not the major factor in the election defeat (Corbyn rebuked after video address avoids mention of election result, 1 January).

Surely he was just as memorable a parody of the sporter of codpieces.Phyllis HydeCoventry • I spotted two flowering daffodils in Stoke Gabriel, Devon, on 31 December.
