The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced on Wednesday that they will be stepping back as “senior royals” and work towards financial self-sufficiency. The bombshell move came after many months of open hostility between Prince Harry and Meghan and the British media and rumours of rifts inside the royal family. Prince Harry had likened the “bullying” his wife received from the tabloid press to the treatment of his mother, Princess Diana. In October, Meghan launched legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a handwritten letter she had sent to her father. Apparently, the couple did not consult other royals before making their announcement. The Sussexes further said that they will be splitting their time between the UK and North America, while “starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution”. In a statement that stunned royal experts, Buckingham Palace appeared surprised and disappointed by the news, while many celebrities took to social media to express their support for the couple’s decision. “We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through,” the palace said. We want to hear your thoughts on what experts have described as an “unprecedented” situation for the royal family. Do you think Prince Harry and Meghan deserve the privacy and independence they are craving? Do you believe they should be allowed to earn a professional living? Or do you feel their plans are inappropriate? Have they let down the Queen and the taxpaying British public, who funded their wedding and many other benefits they enjoyed?
