Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has slashed its profit outlook after what it said was a “very disappointing” year of falling sales and higher costs. The car marque favoured by James Bond is now predicting profits of between £130m to £140m for 2019 – almost half of the £247m it made the previous year. Analysts had been forecasting profits of £196m. It is the second profit warning this year after the firm revealed a slump in sales across Europe in July. Aston Martin’s stock market value has plummeted since it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 2018, at £19 a share, which valued the company at £4.3bn. It is now valued at little more than £1bn. The company on Tuesday blamed a 7% decline in wholesale volumes to 5,809 cars, caused by weak demand in Europe, while the Americas, UK and Asia-Pacific region met the company’s expectations. Sales of its Vantage two-seater sports car had been weak but improved in the fourth quarter. Aston Martin said it remained in discussions with with potential investors. In light of its problems, it is reviewing its planning for this year and trying to make cost savings. Andy Palmer, the chief executive, said: “From a trading perspective, 2019 has been a very disappointing year. Whilst retails have grown by 12%, our best result since 2007, our underlying performance will fail to deliver the profits we planned, despite a reduction in dealer stock levels.”
