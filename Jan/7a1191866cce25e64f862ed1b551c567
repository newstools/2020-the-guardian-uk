Austerity measures have affected our country and, particularly, our community. Food banks and homelessness have increased so dramatically that we wanted to do something to help. After a bit of searching we stumbled across Nightstop, a charity that places homeless people with local hosts who have a spare room. Naturally, we had reservations about letting a stranger into our home, but we were given training and support. We hosted Hamez a few months ago and he couldn’t have been nicer. He has had a difficult time, but was so friendly, funny and positive. To have that kind of outlook in his situation is inspiring. Everyone who has stayed with us was vetted first, and we’ve never had any issues. You meet and learn about different people, and feel as if you’re making a difference, even if it’s just for a night. I’ve been homeless for three years and spent nights on the streets, sleeping rough. Earlier this year, things got bad. I found it harder to access support and became destitute. The shelters were at capacity so I was referred to Nightstop. Being among strangers doesn’t bother me. If anything, I’m more worried for the families, as I know it must be daunting to have someone you don’t know under your roof. I really enjoyed my few nights with Naomi and Leigh. They were kind and made me welcome. I really enjoyed the chat we had while preparing tea. Nightstop was great when there were rooms available – if not, it was the streets. I now have a more permanent place, but I don’t know how the future will unfold. I’m just hoping for the best. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
