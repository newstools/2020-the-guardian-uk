New Orleans police have issued an arrest warrant for Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr after he appeared to slap a security officer on the buttocks earlier this week. The NFL star was celebrating with members of the LSU Tigers in their locker room on Monday night after they beat Clemson to capture the college football national championship. A video has since emerged of Beckham apparently slapping the security guard, who has filed a complaint. Beckham played for the Tigers before joining the professional ranks in 2014. Odell really spanked the cop 🤣 pic.twitter.com/KVNijqK3bM The complaint against Beckham is of simple battery, which in some cases is punishable by a fine and up to six months in prison. “We are aware of the incident and have been in touch with Odell and his representatives on the matter,” the Browns said in a statement issued Thursday. “They are cooperating with the proper authorities to appropriately address the situation.” The 27-year-old had already attracted attention for handing out notes to Tigers players after Monday’s game. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said the notes were cash, which could contravene NCAA rules that bar student athletes from receiving certain benefits. LSU initially said the money was counterfeit but, in a statement on Thursday, said it was reviewing the incident. “We are aware of the situation regarding Odell Beckham Jr. interacting with LSU student-athletes and others unaffiliated with the team following the championship game Monday night,” the LSU statement said. “Initial information suggested bills that were exchanged were novelty bills. Information and footage reviewed since shows apparent cash may have also been given to LSU student-athletes. “We were in contact with the NCAA and the SEC immediately upon learning of this situation in which some of our student-athletes may have been placed in a compromising position. We are working with our student-athletes, the NCAA and the SEC in order to rectify the situation.” Beckham is generally acknowledged as one of the most talented wide receivers in the NFL, and has played for the New York Giants as well as the Browns.
