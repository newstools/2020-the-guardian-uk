It doesn’t matter where you are: fans want to see big names and it was great to see such a large, mixed crowd turn out for Sam Kerr’s debut at Kingsmeadow. Her arrival at Chelsea feels like a gamechanger: the Australian is in her prime and it is the first time a player at her level has come over from the American league. We have seen Carli Lloyd, who played for Manchester City at a later stage of her career, and a few less-celebrated names make the switch but this signing feels different. The Women’s Super League is competing with NWSL to be the best league in the world and people everywhere will have sat up and taken notice. So it was important Kerr got off to a good start and Chelsea will be very happy with her performance in the 3-1 win against Reading. She provided an assist and was fouled in the incident that saw Grace Moloney, the Reading keeper, sent off. It is clear Chelsea went all out to sign the player many people believe is the best in the world. They want to get back into the Champions League and ultimately win it; this was a very promising first appearance and, if we assume Kerr can only get even better with more games, it sets up a fascinating title race. Ouch! 🤕Welcome to the WSL, Sam Kerr. pic.twitter.com/N3uvbZxvKO Casey Stoney will be absolutely fuming with Manchester United after their home defeat to Bristol City, but it could be the kind of result that makes their season. United had been consistent, if not spectacular, in their first top-flight campaign; they’d dominated the teams they should beat and hadn’t disgraced themselves against the big names. But this should have been a home banker and if there was any complacency then Saturday’s result will surely have smartened them up. They had numerous chances and should have taken at least one; United expect a team of winners and that means being ruthless. If this setback hardens them up then it might yet define their campaign; they are still a team I fancy to make a strong Cup run. While we expect more of United nowadays, that is not to dismiss Bristol City. This was their first win of the season and breathes real life into their relegation battle. They don’t have the same big-brother backing from a men’s Premier League team and the people who have built their club up deserve massive respect. Belief can start to fade a bit when the harsh reality of your situation sets in, so this was a monumental result. Officially the first #BarclaysFAWSL goal of the decade...@ebony_salmon 👏 pic.twitter.com/submXCIq4x Arsenal cruised past Birmingham and never had to get into top gear. They remain the team to beat and it was encouraging to see how they mixed things up to good effect. Their first goal, from Kim Little, came from a wonderful ball from Vivianne Miedema but I liked the way their second came from a more direct approach. Leah Williamson got her head up from centre-back and played a great long pass from which Jordan Nobbs scored, and it does no harm to use the length of the pitch like that. It makes them unpredictable and even more dangerous, particularly when many opponents will focus particularly keenly on stopping Miedema. They could have scored more. We know they are capable of it, because they put 11 past Bristol City and it was as if they decided to go out that day to bolster their goal difference. Maybe they need a bit of a nudge to put in more clinical displays and top teams will punish you if you don’t convert enough opportunities, particularly in the Champions League. But overall, this was a case of Joe Montemurro’s side starting 2020 as they left off in 2019 – sometimes making the game look easy. 🗂 Documents └ 🗂 Arsenal Women └ 🗂 Cracking team goals#BarclaysFAWSL x @ArsenalWFC pic.twitter.com/aofFabFzVl Brighton edged past Liverpool in a real six-pointer and, given the scarcity of wins down at the bottom, it gives their hopes of avoiding relegation a massive boost. But Liverpool are not down and out yet. They are looking more offensive and inventive these days, having struggled to create chances early on in the season, and will be encouraged by the debut Rachel Furness made in midfield. Furness has joined from Reading and, if Liverpool are to stay up, it is a fair bet she will be key to their revival. She spent the first part of this season on loan at Spurs and I don’t think they would be where they are now – safely in mid-table – without her influence. She is a real linchpin with great energy, set-pieces and an eye for goal. It was a tremendous coup to sign her and, despite their lowly position, Liverpool will feel energised going into a huge home game against Manchester United. Pauline Bremer scored two more goals for Manchester City in their 4-1 win at Spurs, making it seven in seven WSL games this season and 13 in 14 overall. Nobody expected too much after such a long time out injured, but she is proving the “like a new signing” cliché to be right. Her first goal came after a lovely touch away from a defender and she added another before half-time in a match where City were dominant from start to finish. With Ellen White – who also scored at Tottenham – back and in form too, City should be an attacking force to reckon with from hereon and I feel they needed that, because they have gone a little stagnant in some ways. Their potentially decisive home match against Arsenal is less than a month away and if they can keep up this form, with two refreshed and energised forwards, then it could be game on in the title race. Define: rocket 🚀#BarclaysFAWSL x @ellsbells89 pic.twitter.com/kkEcOPlTn3 Everton’s visit to West Ham was called off after a flu outbreak in the hosts’ squad, and that’s certainly not something I ever encountered in my career. It means Everton must wait a few more days to see Izzy Christiansen in action. Christiansen could be a huge acquisition for them: she was a top player at Manchester City and took a gamble going to Lyon, where she hasn’t had the playing time she wanted. I’m sure she could have stayed with the French club and earned more money sitting on the bench, but she wants to play football and get back into the England fold. She knows Everton well, having started out there, and it’s a move that shows their ambition. They have almost sleepwalked their way through the last three or four years but those days look as if they are over. They have a burning ambition to be back among the top sides again and it will be intriguing to see how they get on this weekend, when they travel to City and the story might just be written to Christiansen to make headlines.
