Greta Thunberg has been mocked and called many names since becoming the world’s most famous climate activist. But amid all the bile and rage from her opponents, there’s one name she has likely never been called: Sharon. Until now. On Thursday’s episode of the BBC quiz show Celebrity Mastermind, the host John Humphrys asked actor Amanda Henderson a question that would soon go viral. “The 2019 book entitled No One is Too Small To Make A Difference is a collection of speeches made by a Swedish climate change activist. What’s her name?” Humphrys asked. The question stumped Casualty star Henderson, who shook her head before answering: “Sharon?” 2020 is cancelled pic.twitter.com/aGDZCTTQmb Delight at Henderson’s incorrect answer, and the way she delivered it, quickly spread, with people sharing the clip in their droves. The moment soon came to the attention of Thunberg, who changed her name on Twitter to Sharon on Friday afternoon, the day she turned 17. The wonderful @GretaThunberg deserves praise for everything she does - including changing her Twitter name to Sharon 😂 pic.twitter.com/jbOzCwx9d4 It’s not the first time Thunberg has changed her Twitter details in response to recent events. In September she turned the tables on Donald Trump and quoted his mockery of her in her bio. And in December, when he baselessly accused her of having anger management issues and told her to “chill”, she changed her bio to “A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.”
