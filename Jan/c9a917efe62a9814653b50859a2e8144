Brian Hughes pointed out after a fall in the first at Wetherby on Thursday that the jump jockeys’ title is “by no means an open goal” despite Richard Johnson’s absence for at least four weeks after suffering a broken arm earlier this week. But it is now overwhelmingly likely that he will end the season as champion, and the fact that he could pick himself off the floor yesterday and then ride the winner of the feature event at 16-1 shows why. Even before Johnson’s painful misfortune, Hughes was riding like a champion, with a 21% strike-rate overall since May which jumped to 24% in December, and he has four chances to add to his lead over Johnson on the Friday Doncaster card. Pogue (12.40) could be the best of them in the opener. Donald McCain’s gelding had a wind op before his chasing debut at Catterick last month and showed definite improvement on his hurdling form to finish second behind the useful prospect Almazhar Garde. The third horse home, meanwhile, was Mah Mate Bob, 17 lengths behind Pogue, who was a winner next time out. Galice Macalo (2.25) was still going well when she fell at the last in a Listed hurdle at Aintree last time, allowing Midnights’ Gift to come home unchallenged. The result was still in the balance but Galice Macalo gets 5lb from Midnights’ Gift when they reoppose today and, unlike her main rival, is a jumps-bred type with plenty of scope for improvement. The first race at Huntingdon should be a straightforward assignment for Nicky Henderson’s promising novice Mister Coffey (12.50) as he steers towards the spring Festival, while Goodbye Dancer (2.35) and Robyndzone (3.35), who made a solid start over fences and races off the same mark here, should also go well at odds that offer more of a reward. On the Flat cards, meanwhile, Bustaan (3.15) is on what could be a very fair mark for his handicap debut at Lingfield, while Klopp (5.15) should extend his winning run at Wolverhampton.
