Málaga’s head coach, Víctor Sánchez, has claimed he was subjected to an attempted blackmail after the 43-year-old was suspended following the posting of an explicit video featuring him on social media. The former Real Madrid midfielder and Spain international, who was appointed by the Segunda División side in April, was captured exposing his penis to the camera while wearing a Málaga training shirt. “I am being subjected to a crime against my privacy with harassment and extortion,” Sánchez wrote on Twitter. “The matter is in the hands of the police and I entrust myself to follow their instructions. Sharing or disseminating an intimate content of any person without consent is also a crime either through social networks or messages or in any other way. Thank you for your understanding and support.” Sánchez spent almost two years out of the game after leaving Real Betis in May 2017 before being appointed by Málaga, who are 16th in Spain’s second tier having won just one of their past five matches. “In relation to the events that have recently been discovered, and which have not as yet been verified, Málaga CF immediately suspends coach Víctor Sánchez del Amo from his duties until a full investigation is carried out,” the club said in a statement. “We will disclose further information once the facts have been clarified.” pic.twitter.com/qVSdB02zvu
