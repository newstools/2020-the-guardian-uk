Thieves have stolen bronze sculptures and etchings by the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí from a gallery in Stockholm in a smash and grab raid. The Couleur gallery, in the Swedish capital’s upmarket Östermalm district, was holding an exhibition of work by Dalí containing about 10 pieces by the Spanish artist, the news agency TT said. “They were worth 200,000 to 500,000 crowns (£16,000 to £40,000) each. So it’s quite a lot of money. It’s terrible,” the gallery owner, Peder Enstrom, told TT. The works by Dalí were on loan from Switzerland, he said. Police said the thieves smashed the gallery’s glass entry doors early on Thursday and made off with the art. “The scene has been cordoned off so that forensics can carry out an examination,” Stockholm police said in a statement. The police declined to give any further information.
