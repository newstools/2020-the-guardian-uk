Cats: they love us, they hate us - they might even actually be genuinely attached to us. But having a cat can make life difficult – especially when it comes to relationships with our neighbours. One dispute over a Maine Coon in west London resulted in a £20,000 court case this week. Jackie and John Hall were perplexed when their cat Ozzy kept coming home with a new collar – they soon found out that he had been making himself at home with a neighbour, who now has an injunction against her that will ban her interacting with the cat.
