Manchester United are considering a fresh bid for Sporting Lisbon’s Bruno Fernandes, with negotiations set to be ramped up before Friday’s 11pm transfer deadline. United had an offer of €45m (£38m) plus add-ons for the 25-year-old midfielder rejected by Sporting, who value Fernandes at €85m. The clubs are prepared to compromise regarding the fee but so far have been too wide apart. Yet the lines of communication are still open and a renewed push by United is expected. A second offer is unlikely to go beyond a base price of €55m. United are weighing up a loan move for the Leicester City striker Islam Slimani, who is on loan at Monaco and has been offered as cover for the injured Marcus Rashford.
