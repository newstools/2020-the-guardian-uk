Quite a lot of people are on diets or launching themselves on to healthy-eating plans. Those: look away. Anyone else: if the new year feels cold and hard and unforgiving, spread some chocolate on it. It doesn’t take a genius to work out which chocolate hazelnut spread I was raised on as an Italian child, but this time I wanted something more grown-up. But still joyful. Obviously, this meant testing lots of jars. Carefully. For sheer mad indulgence the half a kilo La Molina (Selfridges, £26.99) eight-layered white/milk and dark gianduja chocolate spread takes some beating. Winners of the most unusual tasting spreads were Linden’s macadamia white chocolate spread (£8.50): thick, super rich and tastes intensely of macadamia nut (also just 13% sugar if that’s your thing, but shhhh, that’s enough diet talk). And Solkiki’s gianduja chocolate hazelnut spread (£9.90) was interesting, more nutty than chocolatey, with stone-ground palo blanco cocoa beans. For a more traditional spread, look at Slitti’s Riccosa chocolate spread (£12.50) with a whopping 51% hazelnuts; it is gorgeous – but thick not runny. Venchi makes some of the best chocolate spreads ever (sorry, but the Italians do lead in this field), the Suprema 50% (£14.50) hazelnut possibly being my favourite, although for more gooeyness go for the Extra Vergine version. But my top recommendation is Pariani’s (Sous Chef, £6.95) Crema alla Nocciola e Cacao, I love the runny texture, it has only 23g of sugar and 50% Piedmont hazelnuts. It has an all-round ability to please. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
