Derby have been charged by the EFL with recording losses in excess of the permitted amounts under financial fair play rules. Following a review of the Championship club’s profitability and sustainability submissions, the league ruled Derby were in breach of regulations for the three-year period ending 30 June 2018. Last March Birmingham were docked nine points for a breach of the Football League’s profitability and sustainability rules. A loss of £39m is allowed across a three-year period. Derby are 17th in the Championship, 10 points above the relegation zone. “The club will now be referred to an independent disciplinary commission, which will hear representations from both the EFL and Derby County,” said an EFL statement. “As these matters are now subject to proceedings, the EFL will be making no further comment at this time.” More to follow
