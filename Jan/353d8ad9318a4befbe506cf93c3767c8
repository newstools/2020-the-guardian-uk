Leeds have signed striker Jean-Kévin Augustin on loan from Leipzig with a view to a permanent move. The France Under-21 international, who spent the first half of the season on loan at Monaco, is Leeds’ third signing during the January transfer window. “Leeds United are delighted to announce the signing of Jean-Kévin Augustin,” the Championship club announced. “The striker joins the Whites on an initial loan deal until the end of the season from Bundesliga outfit Red Bull Leipzig.” Leeds added: “He will wear the No 29 shirt for Leeds during his time at Elland Road and the club hold the option to sign the player on a permanent basis upon completion of his loan spell.” Augustin progressed through Paris Saint-Germain’s youth system, making his first-team debut in April 2015, and was signed by Leipzig for a reported £11m in the summer of 2017. He scored 20 goals in 67 appearances in all competitions for the Bundesliga club before returning to France on loan with Monaco at the start of this season. No more likes.
