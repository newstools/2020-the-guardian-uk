Nervously chairing for the first time a hearing at the General Medical council, I was fortunate in having Sir Clive Callman acting as legal assessor. The prosecution case was shambolic. I asked Clive what I could do. “You’re the chair: anything so long as it’s fair.” I ordered the senior partner of the solicitors’ firm involved to appear next morning to explain the debacle. He came and apologised at length, my confidence soared and I had few problems coping with lawyers for the next 10 years.
