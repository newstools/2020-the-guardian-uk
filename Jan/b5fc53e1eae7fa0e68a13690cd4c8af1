The runaway league leaders hit the 70 point mark with victory over West Ham in midweek – more than Liverpool have accumulated in 17 of the 27 complete Premier League seasons – and are seeking a 20th consecutive home league win as they close in on the club’s first title in 30 years. It is over a year since Jürgen Klopp’s team last failed to win at Anfield in the league and over two years since they lost to a team outside of the so-called ‘big six’. Southampton have won their last four away league matches to propel themselves out of trouble but a fifth will require a monumental feat.
