A potential preview of the Carabao Cup final. Manchester City are rolling once more after dismantling Manchester United in 45 minutes in midweek. Aston Villa are struggling with injuries and will need to be just as disciplined as they were against Leicester to gain anything positive. Kevin De Bruyne’s revelation that it only took 15 minutes to plan for their Carabao Cup win is ominous. Imagine if they discuessed tactics for Villa a little longer.
