Ten days after the London bridge attack, Darryn Frost wrote a heartfelt message to Usman Khan to leave on the spot of their fatal struggle. He also wrote cards to Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt and placed them on the bridge. They were prayerful offerings and it was a way of processing the trauma, but he had second thoughts about leaving his note to Khan, partly fearing public disapproval of any attempt to forgive the terrorist. He has given the Guardian permission to reproduce it here. “Usman Khan,” he began. “I have written this card upside down, to reflect my world now. You got what you wanted, now you and others are dead. They had no choice. You stole that from them. Jack showed you love and care which many think you did not deserve. This shows Jack’s belief in humanity. You stopped attacking and spoke to me, so you’ll remember who I am. Then on the bridge I stabbed you with the tusk. But as I restrained your arms you will have heard me shouting out to those who started to hit you. I shouted at them to stop and I shifted my body to protect your head and the punching stopped.” He continued: “Then I tried to save your life by restraining your hands to reduce the threat and prevent you from being shot. If only your community who turned you towards hate had shown you some of this care instead. You were used. Those who turned you still live and breathe today. You were just their pawn. Perhaps we can somehow turn your misguided and evil actions to promote love, kindness and compassion.” “Finally,” he wrote, “I leave you a rose from me, which I hang upside down as I try to be as compassionate as Saskia and Jack were, but realise that I still have some way to go. This world needs a balanced view, one free of fear. I will do all I can to extinguish hate, just like I did on that bridge with the others. I will show you, and hopefully the world, the power of love.”
