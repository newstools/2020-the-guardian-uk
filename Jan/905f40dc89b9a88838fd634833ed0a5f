There’s a sketch in Chris Morris’s Jam where a fight breaks out over some poppadoms and it doesn’t really bear describing but it has me in hysterics every time. Comedies I’d watch again and again: The Comeback, The Day Today, The (American) Office. But I’ve probably never laughed at something as much as ’Allo ’Allo when I was seven and I didn’t understand the jokes. I had a T-shirt with the Bristol Stool Chart on it when I was 17. Oh my lord, I just remembered I wore it on a Friday night out in Newcastle city centre. If you wear a T-shirt with the Bristol Stool Chart on it, no one will laugh at your terrible spiky hair. I was doing a sort of sublimated patricidal revenge show where I performed as my dead dad in a huge suit filled with balloons. I made some comment about hoping he wouldn’t haunt it, and a balloon 10ft away from me burst. Beautiful timing on my dad’s part. Kilroy Loops on YouTube. It’s a video made from all of Robert Kilroy-Silk’s introductions to his TV show edited together. That’s it. About the two-minute mark you’ll find yourself entering a sort of trance-like hysteria.
