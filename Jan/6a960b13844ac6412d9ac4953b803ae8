I had never been on Twitter but I’d heard a lot about it, chiefly three things. First, that there is funny stuff on there; second, there is interesting stuff, too; and third – the main thing – that it is a sewer of vileness. I thought I had better take a look. I picked a pseudonym or nom de twit or whatever you might call it, sought advice on a few good follows, and off I went. I don’t tweet, I just watch; or lurk, perhaps. My first shock was just how brilliant it all is. Following thinkers and writers from across the political spectrum, I have quickly learned an almost embarrassing amount about life and the universe and the different prisms through which people see them. I have come across very little vileness; I must be following the wrong people. Dullness is a bigger issue for me. I have had to unfollow some otherwise fascinating people, driven to distraction by the fantastically unfascinating stuff that they also put out there. Who cares if you have just bought the last bottle of sherry in the supermarket? And then there is the self-love. There are people I know to be self-effacing in real life who come across as anything but, as they routinely retweet praise of their lovely selves. Or, even worse, they humblebrag their heads off: “Hey, see this picture of a woman reading my book? I was so flabbergasted I didn’t have the guts to say hello!” Whatever. Am I trolling now, by the way? Am I sinking into that sewer I profess not to see? If so, I am sorry. Who am I to judge anyway? I’m loving every minute of it. Keep up the good work, everyone.
