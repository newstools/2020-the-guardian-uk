With new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access. From autumn 2021, companies will have to consider 15 principles in order to avoid breaking the law and facing fines up to £17m or 4% of global turnover. Some of these principles include: orders to switch off geolocation by default, and to turn off visible location tracking at the end of every session; a block on using “nudge techniques to lead or encourage children to provide unnecessary personal data or weaken or turn off their privacy protections”. We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit. If you are a parent, which ones does your child access? If you are a young person over the age of 17, we would like to hear about the websites you visit and your reasons. You can get in touch with us by filling in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information. If you are under 16, you need permission from an adult to respond to our form.
