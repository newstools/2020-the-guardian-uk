Barnsley have suspended Bambo Diaby from playing for the club after receiving notification that the Football Association is investigating a potential anti-doping violation by the defender. It is understood that the 22-year-old failed a drugs test following defeat by Blackburn in November. The Senegalese defender, who joined Barnsley last summer from the Belgian club Lokeren, faces a maximum four-year ban if found guilty. It is understood he has pleaded his innocence to his teammates and intends to clear his name. “Barnsley football club have received notification from the FA that they are investigating a potential anti-doping violation by our player, Bambo Diaby,” the club said in a statement. “The player and club are cooperating and responding directly with the FA. The player is now subject to a playing suspension whilst this matter is under investigation. During these proceedings, no further comment will be made.” Gerhard Struber, the Barnsley head coach, admitted after his team’s 3-0 defeat by Preston on Tuesday that the noise surrounding Diaby was unhelpful for his players. “It was distracting,” said Struber, who previously reported that the player had been struggling with a knee complaint. “The process is running but it’s not the right time to speak about Bambo.” The FA works in tandem with UK Anti-Doping and carries out random testing on players after games, as well as at training grounds, operating under the World Anti-Doping Authority code.
