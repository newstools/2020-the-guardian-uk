The England and Lions prop Kyle Sinckler has joined Bristol Bears from Harlequins on a two-year deal. The 26 year-old – who will play for Bristol as of next season – has 31 caps for England and played in all three British & Irish Lions’ Tests on the tour to New Zealand in 2017. “Kyle is an outstanding player and it’s fantastic to bring someone of his international calibre to the Bears,” said Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam. “A key part of our vision is developing our homegrown contingent to become England internationals. Kyle can set the example of what it takes for a young player to succeed at the highest level.” Sinckler has made 146 appearances for Harlequins since making his professional debut in September 2011. Sinckler said: “The Bears are an ambitious club on the up . There’s a clear plan in place for long-term success and I’m looking forward to contributing. I’m grateful to Harlequins for everything they have done for me and my career. I’d like to thank the coaches, fans and my teammates for all their support over the years.”
