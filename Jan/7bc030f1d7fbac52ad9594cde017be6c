I believe we should be whatever we want. It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels.” In the same interview, the actor revealed he had suffered from a severe type of insomnia during his childhood. His cause of death has not been announced. A memorial service will be held in Los Angeles on 12 January. • In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.
