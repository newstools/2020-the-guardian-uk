Stephen Dorril (Letters, 9 January) is somewhat unfair to criticise the excellent Lord Parker for being determined to convict Stephen Ward in the Profumo case. The trial judge was Sir Archie Marshall. He was a Cornish liberal and in the year of the trial was elected a bard of the Cornish Gorseth. I have not been able to discover whether he composed a song about any of the men and women in the case.His Honour Paul CollinsHorton-cum-Studley, Oxfordshire • It’s a long time since this octogenarian cried but the valedictory article from Gary Younge (Journal, 10 January) did it for me. Keep in touch, Gary, if only via the occasional report from your new appointment.Peter CaswellWarrington, Cheshire • Our American teacher son-in-law quickly learned the difference between American and British English (Letters, 8 January). When dusting chalk from his trousers, he said: “Oh no! I’ve made a mess of my pants!” to the huge delight of a class of teenagers.Gillian MacintoshBurley-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire • We always used “pants” to mean “trousers” in the part of east Lancashire where I grew up. This did, however, earn me some rather odd looks when I moved south.Ria HopkinsonHolloway, London • I laughed at Susan Chesters’ “bag for life” story (Letters, 10 January). On my fridge is a magnet urging me to “take an old bag shopping”. Attached is a hand-written note from my late wife, simply asking: “Please”.John BoothbyLowton, Greater Manchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
