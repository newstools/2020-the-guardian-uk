Strong gales of up to 80mph are set to sweep across parts of the UK on Monday. The Met Office has issued a warning that coastal routes and communities could be particularly affected by Storm Brendan as large waves batter seafronts. Yellow weather warnings are in place for Northern Ireland, much of the western half of the UK and the north-east of Scotland from midday on Monday to midnight. Frank Saunders, of the Met Office, said the UK and Ireland will turn increasingly windy throughout Monday as the storm, named by the Irish forecaster Met Éireann, sweeps in. He said: “It’s going to be windy across the western half of the UK, with gusts reaching 60-70mph along Irish Sea coastlines, the west of Scotland and perhaps some English Channel coasts – maybe even 80mph in a few exposed places.” Saunders added that the severe conditions could cause travel disruption, and those in affected areas are advised to take extra care when driving on exposed routes such as bridges or high open roads. Looking further ahead to the rest of next week, he said: “It looks like it’s going to stay very unsettled with the potential for further disruptive weather in places.” On Saturday, strong winds and heavy rain battered parts of Scotland, causing road closures and rail disruption. The main A1 road from the English border up to the Edinburgh area was closed to high-sided vehicles for several hours.
