After Jadeveon Clowney knocked out Carson Wentz, Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks knocked off the Philadelphia Eagles. Wilson threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to DK Metcalf, Marshawn Lynch had a rushing score and the Seahawks beat the Eagles 17-9 in the wildcard round of the NFC playoffs on Sunday night. Making his first career playoff start, Wentz lasted two series before exiting with a head injury following a helmet-to-helmet hit from Clowney. Forty-year-old Josh McCown stepped in, becoming the oldest quarterback to make his playoff debut. But he couldn’t lead the Eagles into the end zone. The Seahawks (12-5) lost three of their final four regular season games, including a 26-21 defeat at home against San Francisco in Week 17 that cost them the NFC West title. But they traveled to Philadelphia for the second time in six weeks and became the third team to win on the road this weekend, improving to 8-1 away from home this season. Wilson threw for 325 yards and led the team with 45 yards rushing. Metcalf had seven catches for 160 yards. The Seahawks had a season-high seven sacks from six players. “You’ve got to step it up in the playoffs,” Clowney said. “We knew it was going to be an upfront game, the whole game. They’ve got a great offensive line, great veteran players.” The Seahawks will travel to the Green Bay Packers next week in the divisional round.
