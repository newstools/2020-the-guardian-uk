Your article about the sleeper service between Vienna and Brussels (Goodnight, Vienna: sleeper trains make a green return, 21 January) mentioned upright seats and four- or six-berth couchette cars, but omitted the fact that there are also two-berth cabins, which are, naturally, the most comfortable. My husband and I (in our 70s) already have ours booked for our holiday in Austria in May. You could also have mentioned that the Vienna-Brussels service is just the latest addition to a range of Nightjet sleeper trains run by ÖBB – see www.nightjet.com/en We have used the service between Cologne and Innsbruck several times when travelling to and from Italy. We find them comfortable, the train staff very pleasant, and we enjoy having the breakfast that we ordered the night before delivered to our cabin at a pre-arranged time.Marion HuntEccles, Manchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
