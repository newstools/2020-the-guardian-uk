With less than a month to go until the Oscars, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to 1960s Los Angeles, received a timely boost as it was named the year’s best film at the Critics Choice awards. Handed out by the Los Angeles-based Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Critics Choice awards made Once Upon a Time in Hollywood its leading film, with three other nods, including Brad Pitt for best supporting actor and Tarantino for best screenplay. In an unusual turn of events, the best director prize was a tie between Parasite’s Bong Joon-ho and 1917’s Sam Mendes after voters could not split them. Joaquin Phoenix took home best actor for his portrayal of a tortured loner in Joker, while Renée Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Laura Dern won best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. The Irishman’s stars, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, took to the stage together to accept the best acting ensemble gong. Eddie Murphy, who received a lifetime achievement award, was celebrating again when his Dolemite Is My Name won best comedy film.In the TV categories, Phoebe Waller-Bridge won best actress in a comedy series for Fleabag and had the audience in the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica laughing after admitting her surprise at receiving so much critical adulation for writing a character “who literally looks into the camera and says, ‘Fuck me up the arse.’” She added: “Thank you for getting behind that.” Waller-Bridge, who has also won Emmys and Golden Globes for Fleabag’s second season, described working on the show as “the best experience I’ll probably ever have”. She also thanked Jennifer Lopez for influencing the Priest’s character as his favourite song is her 2002 hit, Jenny from the Block. Waller-Bridge’s co-star Andrew Scott – who plays the Priest – won best supporting actor in a comedy series. Best drama was won by Succession, while best supporting actor in a limited series or movie made for television went to Chernobyl’s Stellan Skarsgård. Netflix’s When They See Us was named best limited series ahead of HBO and Sky’s Chernobyl. Show creator Ava DuVernay thanked the streaming giant for letting “a black woman do her thing”.
