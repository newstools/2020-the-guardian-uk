Internazionale are hopeful of signing Olivier Giroud this week after increasing their bid for the Chelsea striker to €5m (£4.3m). The Inter director Piero Ausilio was in London on Wednesday to discuss a deal with Chelsea for the 33-year-old while also talking to Tottenham about signing Christian Eriksen. Chelsea were unimpressed by Inter’s initial offer of €4m but the Serie A club are now hopeful that their latest bid may just be enough to sign the Frenchman, who has made it clear that he wants to join Inter in an attempt to play more and press his case for a place in France’s Euro 2020 squad. The Frenchman has only played 282 minutes of competitive football this season as the Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has preferred Tammy Abraham up front. Giroud has agreed a deal with Inter for a contract until the end of the 2021-22 season and is now waiting for the clubs to strike a deal. He will be third-choice striker at Inter behind Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez but feels that he will be given more opportunities to play for Antonio Conte than he has been so far at Chelsea this season. Chelsea have turned down an attempt by West Ham to take Ross Barkley on loan. David Moyes had hoped to be reunited with the midfielder after working with him at Everton but Lampard was unwilling to sanction the transfer. Lampard has started Barkley in the past two games, sees him as having a future at Chelsea after injuries and off-field issues and cannot afford to lose a player in that position amid absentees, including with no return date for Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
