Ole Gunnar Solskjær has confirmed Harry Maguire as Manchester United’s new full-time captain, six months after his £80m move from Leicester. Maguire will take the armband from Ashley Young, who is expected to complete his move to Internazionale pending a medical on Friday. “Harry has come in and been wearing the captain’s armband and he will keep wearing it,” said Solskjær. “He has been a leader in the group and I have been not surprised but impressed with his leadership skills.” Talking about Young’s impending switch, Solskjær explained why the former England international had been granted permission to leave. “Well, to be fair, I think it was for Ashley, you know,” he said. “He is 35 in the summer and, if he gets a two-year contract somewhere, I think it’s up to him to take that. We weren’t ready to offer that. “He’s been a good servant for the club. He’s been captain and he’s won trophies, leagues, cups, but we’ve got players coming through so it was time now, then. When Ashley’s head and mindset was on: ‘Yeah, I want to try this’, why not do it now?” Solskjær also cast doubt on Marcus Rashford’s hopes of shaking off a back injury for Sunday’s Premier League game with Liverpool. Rashford made a brief appearance in the midweek FA Cup win over Wolves which may have cost him his chances of figuring at Anfield. “We’re going to give him the absolute amount of time but I am not going to hold my breath,” added Solskjær. “I would think that he probably wouldn’t be ready but he’s still got 48 hours so let’s see.”
