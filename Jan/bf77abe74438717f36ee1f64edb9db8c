Excellent article by Edward Bullmore in Journal (Inflammation is the new frontier in public health, 20 January). Unfortunately it does not fully explore the role of prevention. It is now being proven that sleep plays a major role in repairing the body, and in particular the brain, especially from the ravages of inflammation. After all, why do we sleep? Inflammation is an essential part of our existence – it’s the way the body responds to an attack from without or within. Unfortunately this also causes damage in other areas, including the brain. Hence the value of a good night’s sleep. This should become the number one priority in public health, not spending billions chasing a unicorn. I recommend that everyone also reads Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep.Dr Guru SinghShepshed, Loughborough • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
