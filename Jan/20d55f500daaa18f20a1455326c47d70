My love of marmalade is boundless, and can be attributed to an inherent passion for all things bittersweet. Several generations of my family now breakfast on toast, butter and my grandmother’s infamous five-sugar marmalade. I shall be making my own batch this year and folding some of it into this sensationally moreish bread pudding – just for an extra dose. The bright, citrussy notes of this pudding, and its blanket of creamy, bitter-sweetness, is a real antidote to the months of January and February. Prep 30 minRest 30 minCook 40 minServes 4-6 300g softened butter300g brioche loaf, cut in half lengthways6 tbsp thick-cut dark marmalade3 eggs60g dark brown sugar2 tbsp whisky275ml whole milk75ml double creamA few gratings nutmegZest of 1 lemonZest of 1 small orange1 tbsp demerara sugar To serveThick double cream,  or creme fraiche Butter the cut side of the bottom half of the brioche with half the butter, then spread over five tablespoons of the marmalade. Put the other half of the loaf on top and cut it into sandwiches, then cut each sandwich into two triangles. Butter the tops of the triangles, then put them into a baking dish that comfortably fits them. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Whisk the eggs and sugar, then whisk in the whisky, milk, cream and remaining marmalade. Grate in the nutmeg, lemon and orange zest. Pour the custard over the brioche sandwiches, pushing the bread down into the liquid so that it is completely covered. Leave to rest for 30 minutes. Scatter the demerara sugar over the top of the pudding and bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden and puffed up. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving with cream or creme fraiche. If there is any leftover pudding, cut it into small pieces and fold it into softened vanilla ice-cream, before returning it to the freezer. Leftover lemons can be squeezed to make hot lemon and ginger tea.
