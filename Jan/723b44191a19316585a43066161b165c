Damaging winds produced by thunderstorms across central New South Wales have whipped up dust storms that turned daytime into night in some towns. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a series of severe thunderstorm warnings on Sunday evening for inland NSW with the associated winds generating massive dust clouds. Videos posted to social media showed dust storms descending on Dubbo and nearby towns that were so thick they blocked out the sun. Nyngan‘s Grace Behsman took this video of a huge dust storm rolling in as they approached town. Watch til end - scary moment when the storm overtakes and everything goes black. The dust storm has swept the west & is encroaching Dubbo.

AGAIN! #fudust #sickofcleaning #whenwillwegetrain pic.twitter.com/NHQKkVT7gy A gust of 94 km/h was recorded at Parkes about 6.30pm while a gust of 107 km/h was recorded at Dubbo about 7.45pm, the bureau said. A bureau meteorologist, Rose Barr, said Sunday’s significant rain was concentrated across central and northern parts of the state on, and east, of the ranges. Many towns on the mid-north coast and the northern rivers regions received between 100mm and 180mm from 9am to 10.30pm on Sunday. In the southern part of the state, high winds saw storms race overhead quickly, resulting in lower measured falls. Downpours over the past few days have provided relief for parts of drought-stricken NSW and helped firefighters slow the spread of bushfires and build containment lines before increased fire danger mid-week. The thunderstorms will continue on Monday. “Tomorrow we have a very active thunderstorm day forecast, particularly across south-eastern and central-eastern parts of the state, as well as parts of the south-west slopes,” Barr said. But again they were likely to move quickly with some “extremely strong wind gusts”. There could also be large hailstones. Winds will shift and come more from the north and west midweek, bringing drier and warmer air on Wednesday and Thursday. “That means on both of those days we may end up seeing fire dangers increasing again and causing more problems for our fire agencies,” Barr said. But moisture will return on Friday and the weekend. The death toll from the state’s unprecedented bushfires climbed to 21 at the weekend after the death in hospital of an 84-year-old man burned in Cobargo on New Year’s Eve. The man was taken from his home on 31 December to South East Regional hospital before he was transferred to Concord hospital in Sydney, where he died in the early hours of Saturday.
