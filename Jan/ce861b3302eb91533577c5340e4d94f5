Kirk Cousins hit tight end Kyle Rudolph with a touchdown on third-and-goal in overtime, and the Minnesota Vikings pulled out a 26-20 victory over the Saints in the wildcard round of the NFC playoffs on Sunday. It was the second straight season the Saints’ campaign ended in overtime in the Superdome. “Well, we’ll go one week at a time, but the Saints are the real deal,” Cousins said after the game. “This is a really tough environment. It was a team win. We ran the ball, we played good defense. To hold that offense to 20 points is a great job. Special teams gave us great field position all game long. And then we were able to make the play at the end with Rudy.” If you want it, #GoGetIt.AND @kylerudolph82 WANTED IT. pic.twitter.com/0xgXJWxcRk The disappointing end for the favored Saints (13-4), came nearly a year after New Orleans lost in the NFC championship game to the Los Angeles Rams in a game marred by missed Rams penalties late in regulation. On Sunday, Dalvin Cook gained 130 yards from scrimmage and scored two touchdowns. Cousins finished with 242 yards and one touchdown pass. He hit Adam Thielen with a 43-yard completion on the opening possession of overtime to give Minnesota (11-6) the ball on the Saints’ two-yard line and set up the winning score. Minnesota’s defensive front forced record-setting quarterback Drew Brees into two turnovers one game after the Saints had finished the regular season with an NFL record-low eight. The Vikings will face the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers on Saturday afternoon in the divisional round.
