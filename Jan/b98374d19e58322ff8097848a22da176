Inter have offered Christian Eriksen a four-year deal and are looking into the possibility of signing the Dane in this transfer window. The 27-year-old is out of contract in the summer and Inter met with his agent, Martin Schoots, in Milan on Friday to present a contract they hope will persuade the attacking midfielder to join the club. Inter have not ruled out trying to sign Eriksen in this window – in which case it would be a four-and-a-half-year deal – and are prepared to offer €20m (£17m) to secure his services despite him only having six months left on his contract. Several other clubs are interested, including Paris St-Germain, and Eriksen will meet his agent in the next few days to discuss the offer. Eriksen said last summer that he was ready for a new challenge, telling media in Denmark: “I feel that I am at a stage of my career where I would like to try something new. I have the deepest respect for everything that is happening at Tottenham and it would not be something negative to stay. But I have also said that I would like to try something new.” Tottenham, however, have lost Harry Kane to injury and their manager, José Mourinho, is short of options up front. Eriksen has been one of the team’s most creative players since joining from Ajax in 2013, although his influence has waned this season. Aston Villa have agreed a deal to sign the former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina for the rest of the season. The Spain international, who is currently at Milan, is expected to undergo a medical on Monday and join the Midlands club on loan. Villa have been looking for goalkeeping cover after Tom Heaton picked up a knee injury on New Year’s Day and was ruled out for the rest of the campaign.
