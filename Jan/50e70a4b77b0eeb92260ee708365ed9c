A proposed ban on children under 12 heading the ball in training is expected to be announced by the Scottish Football Association. The report by University of Glasgow researchers, released last October, found that ‘among former players, mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary or a contributory cause on the death certificate’. A similar ban has been in place in the US since 2015 but would become the first European country to impose such a restriction. Whether you are a parent of a child who plays football, play football yourself or are a former player, we would like to hear from you. How do you feel about the proposed ban? Do you have concerns about your child who plays football? Balls have got lighter over the years but we’re also interested in hearing from older players – do you think you have been affected by heading?
