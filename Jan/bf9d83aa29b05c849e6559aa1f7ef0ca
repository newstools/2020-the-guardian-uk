I knew Herbert Chappell from when he was working on his doctorate at Oxford. Having graduated in English, I embarked, without formal qualifications and a background in jazz, on studying music for a second first degree. By generously lending me his notes, Bert made it possible for me to concentrate on composition, and so to on to work in music education. I cannot thank him enough.
