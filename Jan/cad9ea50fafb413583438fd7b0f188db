In a record-baking effort about 1,500 bakers and chefs in southern India have baked what they said was the world’s longest cake: about 6.5km. They spread chocolate ganache on the serpentine dessert which was stretched out on thousands of tables and desks at a festival ground and adjoining roads in Keralan city of Thrissur. The vanilla cake, 10cm wide and thick, weighed about 27,000kg. The bakers and chefs, wearing traditional whites and toque blanche caps, spent nearly four hours on Wednesday putting the cake together using 12,000kg of sugar and flour. Large crowds watched the event which was organised by Bakers Association Kerala. The group’s secretary general, Naushad, who uses one name, said Guinness World Records had assessed the cake as being 6,500m but its confirmation of the exact length was pending. That much cake would surpass the Guinness record held by Chinese bakers in Zixi county who made a 3.2km fruitcake in 2018. “This is an effort to showcase our skills to the world,” Naushad said. “We ensured hygiene and taste are up to the mark.”
