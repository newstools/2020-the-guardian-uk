There are times where cooking feels like both science and magic. Take, for example, the date toffee at the heart of this recipe. There’s science here, of course – the caramelisation of sugars and emulsification of fats – but it feels more like magic, with three disparate ingredients bubbling away like a brewing potion to give something altogether different and uniquely delicious: a luxuriously rich but delicately fruity toffee. Or perhaps I’m overthinking it and just need to read a bit less sci-fi and fantasy this year. The best place to find date syrup is in health or Middle Eastern food shops. Or, failing that, online. Soak the dates in orange juice an hour or two before you start. Prep 15 minSoak 1 hrCook 1 hr 30 minMakes 16 squares 200g orange juice175g medjool dates, chopped into 1cm pieces150g unsalted butter150g light muscovado sugar5 large eggs300g plain flour2 tsp baking powder200g date syrup For the toffee sauce150g date syrup75g unsalted butter200g double cream An hour or two before you start, pour the orange juice over the dates and leave to soak. To make the toffee sauce, stir all three ingredients in a saucepan and leave to simmer on a low heat. Give it an occasional stir, scraping the base and sides of the pan to make sure none of the mixture scorches. After about 30 minutes, you will see a clear layer of fat sitting on top of the toffee. At this point, turn off the heat and leave to cool, stirring the fat back into the mix to give a smooth, spreadable toffee. To make the cake, cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer, then stir in the eggs, flour, baking powder and syrup, followed by the soaked dates. Pour the mixture into a 23cm square cake tin lined with greaseproof paper and greased with a little butter. Bake at 170C (160C fan)/gas 4 for 45-50 minutes, until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool, then spread the toffee sauce all over the top and slice into squares.
