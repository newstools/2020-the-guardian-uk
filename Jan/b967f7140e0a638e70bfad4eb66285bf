According to the government’s Insolvency Service, the number of personal insolvencies in England and Wales climbed to a nine-year high last year. The overall insolvency rate of women has now overtaken the rate among men, with insolvencies amongst women aged 65 and over increasing from 1,109 in 2008 to 2,082 in 2018 – an increase of 88% in a decade. We’d like to hear from women who have had to face insolvency. We’re particularly interested if you are a woman who has been insolvent over the age of 65. What was your experience like?
