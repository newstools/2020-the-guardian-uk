I ordered two charms online at a cost of £58.99 from jewellery brand Pandora at the end of November, as a Christmas gift. The package arrived at my local Big Yellow self-storage reception in early December. (I have my parcels sent there as I’ve had issues with items being left with neighbours.) When I collected the package the following week, the box looked as though it had never been sealed, and one of the charms – the Christmas-themed one – was missing. CCTV only showed that it had been delivered. I tried for days to ring Pandora e-store’s customer service, but the message was always the same: “Ten or more people before you, we recommend you call back later.” I have also emailed, but there was no response. The latest message said it was not receiving calls at all. It was meant to be a Christmas present and I am unable to resolve this. AK, Poole, Dorset We also tried ringing, emailing and tweeting (and were even unable to get through to Pandora’s London head office), but eventually received a response. Pandora has clearly struggled with a backlog arising from its own festive order book, as the sheer volume of calls before and after Christmas meant it was often impossible to speak to a member of staff. That’s really not impressive for a brand of this scale. Without providing us with an explanation (and we did ask), it has apologised “for the inconvenience and disappointment caused”, and agreed to refund you in full.
