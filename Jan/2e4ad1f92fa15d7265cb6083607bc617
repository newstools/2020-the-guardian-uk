Rabbi Dr Barbara Borts calls Paul the Apostle “a troublesome character” (Letters, 28 December). He was a man of his time, but before you write him off read chapter 13 of his first letter to Corinthians. He says, among other things: “Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things … Pursue love.”Val SpougeBraintree, Essex • Your editorial (3 January) rightly lambasts the Australian government for its attitude to climate change but on the back page of the same edition you print a full-page advert for high-carbon budget airfares under the banner “The world has never been closer”. Substitute “closer” with “hotter” and we might have the truth of it. Tutting on the sidelines is no longer good enough. The Guardian is in the game too and needs to up it.Richard HawksworthHorwich, Bolton • Cherry Weston (Letters, 27 December) gets to the heart of Labour’s communications crisis.
