Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. It’s a month since I handed £30 or more to each of my many nieces and nephews for Christmas. Not a single one has sent a thank-you note since. Should I just accept that’s how kids are these days or have a word with their parents? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
