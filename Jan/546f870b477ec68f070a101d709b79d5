Rootin’-tootin’ Everyone from Margot Robbie to Saoirse Ronan and Michelle Pfeiffer rocked dark hair roots at the Golden Globes. Vulvas and exorcisms Together in one TV show! Gwyneth Paltrow’s Netflix offering, The Goop Lab, launched yesterday. Bingeworthy. Stormzy v Wiley The first beef of 2020! See Stormzy’s new diss track Disappointed. Rainbow lashes As seen on the AW20 menswear catwalk at Xander Zhou. Flutter, flutter. Novelty cakes See the M&S classic Colin the Caterpillar, and now Asda’s smiley vegan avocado-shaped chocolate cake. Too adorbs to eat. Almost. Blue light From phones, laptops etc. Enter blue light-blocking glasses, which – anecdotally, at least – are a godsend. Stylish, too. Pancakes Usurped by Sri Lankan egg hoppers – on menus from Little Lanka in Stockport to London chain Hoppers – and taking over our socials. Delish. Ice cubes in cereal À la Kiss musician Gene Simmons, who revealed his preferred breakfast combo on Twitter. It’s a no from us. Valentine’s lingerie The new Christmas jumper. To wit: buy clothes you can wear all year round. Doggos From @christopher_the_pig to @mybestfriendhank, pigs are taking over as the Insta animal of choice. It’s a hog’s life.
