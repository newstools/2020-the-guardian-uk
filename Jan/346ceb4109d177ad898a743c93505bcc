Internazionale are in talks with Manchester United over the transfer of Ashley Young, with the 34-year-old ready to accept a contract until 2021 with the Serie A club. Young, who did not feature in United’s 3-1 defeat by Manchester City in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday night, is out of contract at Old Trafford in the summer and has made 10 Premier League starts this season. Inter have held talks with United over whether they will have to pay a fee for the former England international and he is understood to be keen to reunite with former United teammates Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez under the former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. However, when asked about the prospective move for the club captain after the City defeat, United’s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, seemed less than impressed. “It’s not the night to talk about players leaving,” he said. “We’ve got a few months left and we can’t weaken ourselves, we need to strengthen ourselves, if any movement is going to happen. I don’t know what you are talking about. Ask Ash.” Meanwhile Aston Villa are hoping to persuade Milan to sell the Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek, having held talks with the Italian club on Monday over a prospective bid of €28m for the 24-year-old. Piatek has already rejected a move to Crystal Palace but Villa would like him to replace the Brazil striker Wesley, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
