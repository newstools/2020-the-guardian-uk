A passenger plane skidded on to a highway after landing at an airport in south-west Iran, state media have reported. “It ran out of runway when landing at Mahshahr airport with no casualties,” the IRNA said. Other Iranian media outlets reported that 135 passengers and seven crew members were onboard the Caspian Airlines plane but there was no official confirmation. The IRNA, quoting local aviation officials, said a technical issue delayed the plane’s landing, leading to the overrun at Mahshahr in Khuzestan province on Monday. Iranian media reported that the pilot was unable to deploy the landing gear, adding that the incident was being investigated. Photographs of the aircraft show registration number EP-CPZ, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 built in 1994. “The plane did not catch fire and all passengers safely left the plane,” Mohammad Reza Rezaei, the managing director of Khuzestan airports, told the IRNA. An unverified video shared on social media showed an evacuation of passengers from the plane in the middle of a highway. On Saturday, an Iranian airplane en route from Tehran to Istanbul made an emergency landing at a Tehran airport because of a technical problem, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran’s airlines have been plagued by crashes, which the country’s rulers blame on US sanctions that block the airlines from replacing their ageing fleets or purchasing spare parts from the west.
