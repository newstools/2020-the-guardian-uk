The home of Ed Woodward was attacked on Tuesday night in a sickening escalation of the tensions between supporters and the Manchester United executive vice-chairman. Fans, who are unhappy at the way in which the club is being run, have recently sung songs celebrating the death of the 48-year-old who has become a figure of hate among some sections of the United support. However, the situation took a sinister turn on Tuesday night when a group wearing balaclavas launched flares at Woodward’s Cheshire home. One video was then posted on social media with the caption: “Ed Woodward’s gonna die.” It is understood neither Woodward nor his family were at home. He is married with two young daughters. United quickly released a strongly worded statement condemning those involved and promising to hand out life bans to anyone found guilty of any criminal offence. A spokesman said: “Manchester United Football Club have tonight been made aware of the incident outside the home of one of our employees. “We know that the football world will unite behind us as we work with Greater Manchester Police to identify the perpetrators of this unwarranted attack. “Anybody found guilty of a criminal offence, or found to be trespassing on this property, will be banned for life by the club and may face prosecution. “Fans expressing opinion is one thing, criminal damage and intent to endanger life is another. There is simply no excuse for this.” Defeats at Arsenal and at home to Burnley have increased the pressure on United, who are 33 points behind the Premier League leaders Liverpool.
