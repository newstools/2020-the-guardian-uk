The suggestion that repairs on Big Ben should be suspended so that it can ring out to celebrate Brexit (Report, 15 January) illustrates the brazen insensitivity of the source from which it appears to emanate, and would be a slap in the ear for the 63% of the electorate who either voted to remain or did not vote. Send not to ask for whom the bell tolls…Rev John JamesWatchfield, Somerset • We should support suggestions that all churches throughout the four nations should mark the last hours of the 31 January by ringing their bells. A single funereal tolling bell between 10pm and midnight would set the right tone.Nigel GannLichfield, Staffordshire • The PM’s scheme for everyone to give a bob towards Big Ben’s chimes reminds me of Caligula, who, just after he became emperor and had a baby daughter, put a box outside the palace saying their leader was having difficulty funding his family and needed his subjects to each make a contribution to its upkeep. Let’s hope our leader of the UK isn’t asking us to fund his baby – Brexit – and all of its costs.Slocombe LennoxClifton, Bristol • £500,000 for Big Ben to chime on 31 January? Black arm bands may be cheaper.Shirley WilliamsChapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire • Ringing the bell at Lloyds on 31 January 2020, as for a disaster at sea, would be more appropriate.Rosemary BentleyEgham, Surrey • If the bells are rung it should be a muffled peal.Rev Maurice WrightBayston Hill, Shropshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
