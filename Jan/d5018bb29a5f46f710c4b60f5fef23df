Mariah Carey’s Twitter account appeared to have been hacked late Tuesday afternoon, sharing numerous racist slurs and comments with the singer’s 21.4 million followers on the platform. It’s unclear who’s behind the hack, and the pop star did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most of the tweets published on Tuesday afternoon were quickly deleted. Many verged on the nonsensical and appeared to troll the singer’s fans. “Personally I don’t think racism is real, it’s just pussy boy talk,” one tweet read. “Eminem has a small penis,” read another. (Mariah Carey and rapper Eminem once had a very public feud, in which he claimed to have slept with the singer.) Twitter users were quick to jump in and deliver their own commentary on the bizarre situation. “Hacking Mariah Carey is a federal offense so I hope it was worth it!” one user wrote. Mariah Carey has become a renewed focal point of pop culture in recent weeks, through her record-breaking achievements on the Billboard Chart. The singer’s modern classic “All I Want For Christmas” hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time this month – 25 years after its original release. And on Monday, Billboard announced Carey is projected to become the first artist to have number-one hits in four consecutive decades, when “All I Want For Christmas” tops the 4 January 2020 Hot 100 list. “What’s a decade?” the singer jokingly tweeted after the news broke, when she was allegedly still in control of her account.
