After the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care. At this time of year, The Guardian’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories. Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues. Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers. We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.
