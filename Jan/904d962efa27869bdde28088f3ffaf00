Saeb Erekat opines that the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state will advance peace (Opinion, 19 January). Rather inconveniently for him, the exact opposite is true. In making his demand, Erekat has knowingly reneged on the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s peace process commitment to solve all outstanding matters through negotiations with Israel. If the Palestinian leadership can receive international recognition for a declaratory state without directly negotiating, why would they ever seek genuine talks and reconciliation? The global community has long agreed that direct peace talks are the only way forward, and Israel remains willing to discuss all the contested issues. Despite this, the Palestinian leadership has consistently refused to engage in such talks and has instead sought to bypass them (Erekat’s piece being the latest example). For the Palestinians, there is always an excuse to avoid negotiations. Unilateral recognition will only prolong the Palestinians’ delusion that progress is possible without direct talks. Erekat’s proposal may be a useful distraction from the Palestinian Authority’s failing leadership and its past rejection of numerous serious opportunities for reconciliation. If implemented, it would only serve to undermine peace and condemn his own people to the perpetuation of the status quo.Mark RegevAmbassador of Israel to the UK
