The Guardian photographer Peter Johns captures a joyful winter scene on a frozen pond on Wimbledon Common, London, in January 1970. Johns, who died in 2017 aged 86, brought a distinctive artistic approach to his work. He was part of a new wave of British photojournalists who emerged in the 1960s and 70s. One of his biggest stories was his series on the Aberfan disaster in 1966. He didn’t just follow the press into the village, but climbed the mountain above to get some stunning and evocative photographs of the collapsed coal tip that engulfed a school, farm and several houses, killing 144 people.
