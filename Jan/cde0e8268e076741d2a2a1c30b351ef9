Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My son, who has just turned 17, is keen to learn to drive this year. What have other parents found to be the most cost-effective way to learn? The cost of putting him on our insurance alone is shocking. Is it better to just pay for lessons only? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
