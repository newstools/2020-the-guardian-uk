Wales go into the first match of this year’s Six Nations as defending champions, having dethroned Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on the final day of the 2019 tournament. Wales won the grand slam last year for the first time since 2012, but they no longer have Warren Gatland pulling the strings. Their opponents in the opening game, Italy, will just be hoping to win a match. Their last victory in the tournament was back in 2015. We want to hear your expectations for the tournament this year. Will England kick on after some impressive performances in the World Cup or will the Saracens scandal affect their players? Will Ireland recover after a disastrous showing in Japan? Are you excited, cautiously optimistic or fearing the worst? You can get in touch with us by filling in the encrypted form below.
