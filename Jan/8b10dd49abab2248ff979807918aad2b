Watford are close to making their first signing of the transfer window with Ignacio Pussetto set to join from Udinese for €8m (£6.8m). The 24-year-old forward has been with Udinese since 2018 and has made 47 Serie A appearances in that time, scoring five goals and providing five assists. He has mainly been on the bench this season and has not completed 90 minutes once during the 2019-20 campaign. Both Watford and Udinese are owned by the Pozzo family and there have been many transfers between the two clubs since they acquired the Premier League club in 2012, with Stefano Okaka and Ken Sema two of the latest examples. Pussetto is likely to add competition in the attacking positions but is not expected to go straight into the starting XI. His arrival may well see Isac Success leave the club as his role has become more and more peripheral. Watford’s form has improved dramatically since Nigel Pearson took over from Quique Sánchez Flores on 7 December. The former Leicester manager lost his first game in charge, against Liverpool, but is undefeated since then, having won four and drawn one in the league, catapulting Watford to 17th in the table.
