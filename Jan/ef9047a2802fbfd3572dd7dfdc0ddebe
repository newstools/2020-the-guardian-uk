The book I am currently readingI am reading Ann Patchett’s The Dutch House and listening to the audio of Richard Russo’s Chances Are in the car. I need a chip in the brain to be able to read while I sleep. The book I wish I had writtenWar and Peace – and the Harry Potter series, of course. The book that influenced meOne Thousand and One Nights. I read it when I hit puberty, when my hormones were exploding, in Beirut, hiding in a cupboard because it was supposed to be sexy. It plunged me into a world of fantasy and eroticism from which I have never been able to emerge. The book that is most overratedThe Bible. The book that changed my mindIt didn’t change it, just confirmed that I was not crazy: The Female Eunuch by Germaine Greer. The book I couldn’t finishThere are hundreds of those. If I am bored by page 60, I leave it. And I can’t read about violence (such as Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho) or cruelty to animals. The last book that made me cryThe Devil’s Highway by Luis Alberto Urrea, about desperate Mexicans and Central Americans trying to cross the border into the US. The last book that made me laughThe scene in City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert, in which the protagonist loses her virginity with the help of a veterinarian. I heard it on audio in my car and had to pull over laughing like a lunatic. The book I’m most ashamed not to have readIn Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. The book I give as a giftBroken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow by Elizabeth Lesser, and to all my animal-lover friends I give the novel Lily and the Octopus by Steven Rowley. My earliest reading memoryScandinavian fairytales with lovely illustrations. My comfort readingNo book, just a blank notepad to write down some ideas for my next novel. The book that changed my lifeMy own book, The House of the Spirits, changed my life. It gave me a voice and made me a writer when my life was going nowhere. The book that had the greatest influence on my writingOne Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. I felt that it could be the story of my family – it was like listening to the voices of my grandparents. • A Long Petal of the Sea by Isabel Allende is published by Bloomsbury (RRP £16.99).
