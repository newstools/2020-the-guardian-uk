This 40-minute, 19-song cycle about the aftermath of the first world war isn’t the most obvious commercial follow-up to Field Music’s glorious 2018 Top 30 album, Open Here. In fact, Making a New World was originally a commission for performances in the Imperial War Museum, but Peter and David Brewis felt proud enough of the resulting songs to release them as a concept album. The opening two short instrumentals evoke artillery fire on either side of the armistice: there are percussion sounds like falling bombs and mournful, Erik Satie-like pianos and eerie near-silences. Songs segue into each other as war is considered from unusual angles. The lovely A Change of Heir is about the pioneering skin graft work that led to today’s gender reassignment surgery. Coffee or Wine ponders the armistice agreement from the perspective of a traumatised officer returning home to a much-changed family life. Money Is a Memory brings a dash of Chic to the subject of post-war reparations, but the often oblique lyrics are never allowed to stand in the way of another strong set of tunes, rooted in left-field pop (notably XTC) and disco. Only in a Man’s World, a song about the development of sanitary towels and how advertising treats menstruation as something shameful, finds David Brewis barking, “Why should a woman feel ashamed?” in the manner of Talking Heads’ Once in a Lifetime. Between Nations is another gem, a gently gear-shifting, psychedelic landscape about – of course – the futility of war.
