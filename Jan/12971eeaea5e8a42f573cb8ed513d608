The Queen strikes a familiar pose with handbag firmly looped on forearm in a new portrait alongside three future kings, released to mark the start of the decade. The historic photograph, taken in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace, is only the second formal portrait of the sovereign with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George. The first was in April 2016, on the occasion of the Queenâ€™s 90th birthday, when George, then not quite aged three, had to stand on foam blocks to raise him to the height of the seated adults. That portrait was used on special commemorative stamps. In this latest, now aged six, long tartan trousers replace the shorts, but the young George retains a princely preference for white shirts with piped collar and cuffs. Both portraits are by photographer Ranald Mackechnie.
