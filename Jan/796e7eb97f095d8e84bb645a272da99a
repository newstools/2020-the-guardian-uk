Luke Cowan-Dickie could miss England’s Six Nations opener against France on Sunday after returning home from the squad’s Portugal training base for family reasons. Cowan-Dickie is Eddie Jones’ second choice hooker behind Jamie George but he departed the Algarve on Tuesday night. If he is unable to rejoin England in time for Friday’s team announcement, Bath front row Tom Dunn will be given the chance to make his debut off the bench in Paris with Jack Singleton on standby to be called up as cover. Defence coach John Mitchell said: “Luke has returned home for family reasons. We’ve got plans in place just in case he can not return.”
