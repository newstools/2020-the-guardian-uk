Disgraced Cardinal George Pell has reportedly been moved from his central Melbourne prison to a high security facility in regional Victoria after a drone was flown over the jail. “Corrections Victoria can confirm an incident involving a drone flying over the Melbourne assessment prison on Thursday,” a justice department spokeswoman said on Sunday. The drone was reportedly flying near a visitors’ garden at the prison in Melbourne’s CBD. Pell has been held at the prison for almost a year after his 2018 conviction for sexually assaulting two teenage choirboys at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral in the mid-1990s. He had been given a job weeding and watering a garden inside the prison. It has been speculated the drone may have been used to get pictures of Pell, which could be worth a significant sum. He has reportedly been moved to the maximum security Barwon prison, near Geelong, since the incident which has been referred to Victoria police. It is illegal to fly a drone within 120 metres of a prison or youth justice facility, and doing so can result in up to two years’ jail.
