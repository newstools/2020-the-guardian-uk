The Travel section on rail journeys in Europe (11 January) was interesting and informative. However, next time perhaps you could add a supplement on how to get to London by train for those of us who do not live near there, as this is often the most unreliable, time-consuming or expensive part of the journey. It is easier, and often cheaper, to fly from Liverpool to Madrid and start our train journey there; and, yes, we are aware of the environmental cost, but until train journeys in the UK improve radically it will remain the preferred option.Kathleen HooperOswaldtwistle, Lancashire • So train operator FirstGroup wants to “ensure we reach the right outcome for the government, our shareholders and our customers” (Report, 8 January).
