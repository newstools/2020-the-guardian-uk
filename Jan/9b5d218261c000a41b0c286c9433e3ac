This week, scientists from Harvard demonstrated that stress can accelerate the greying of human hair. The researchers found that stress prompts the production of a hormone that affects the melanocyte cells involved in making hair pigments. The scientists hope that this discovery will add to the understanding of how the depletion of stem cells contributes to ageing in general. Scientists have long known that the reservoir of melanocyte cells is key to pigment production. A group of French scientists have developed agents that mimic the action of a naturally occurring enzyme that protects the cells. They are working on commercialising the product but if successful it would prevent greying, rather than reversing it. Premature greying can be caused by autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo and alopecia areata. Premature ageing syndromes, where all aspects of ageing are sped up, such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria and Werner syndrome also result in greying. Genes are thought to regulate greying, but scientists have yet to identify those responsible. A study by the Autonomous University of Barcelona revealed that a side-effect of new immunotherapy drugs is that they may restore hair pigment. Out of 52 lung cancer patients in the research, 13 found their grey hair darken to brown or black and one patient experienced colour in patches, as a result of the drugs. They also found that 13 of these 14 responded better to the cancer treatment. Smoking, obesity and a family history of going grey early all contribute to premature greying. Those with a paternal history of early grey are most at risk, according to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
