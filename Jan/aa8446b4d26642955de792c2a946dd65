There’s a distinct whiff of just about everyone’s favourite British winter pudding in this seasonal cocktail, hence the name. It’s just a simple assembly job, too, with no flashy bartender tricks. Serves 1 40ml bourbon30ml apple juice5ml vanilla extract5ml cannelle syrup5ml amaretto1 slice lemon, to rim the glass1 digestive biscuit, crushed1 apple fan, to garnish Put all the liquids in a shaker, add ice and shake hard. Rub the lemon all around the rim of a martini glass, then dip the top of the glass in the crushed biscuit mix, to coat. Double-strain the contents of the shaker into the glass, taking care not to dislodge the biscuit, garnish with an apple fan and serve. • Yoann Carrot, The Cutting Room Bar & Restaurant, London W1.
