Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will host the Golden Globes in 2021. Poehler shared the announcement at a meeting of TV critics in Pasadena, California on Saturday, a week after the ceremony aired with Ricky Gervais as host. “There are no two funnier people anywhere,” said Poehler, who introduced herself as the NBC publicist who was to have opened the network’s daylong presentation about its programming. A tongue-in-cheek Poehler said the network was glad the pair found time in their busy schedules to take on the Globes. They have hosted three times before. Last Sunday, Gervais’ snarky jokes in his fifth turn as host received mixed reviews and reactions from the celebrity audience. Poehler and Fey earned a warmer reception for their comedic approach. Gervais repeatedly said it was the last time he intended to emcee. “There’s no denying that Tina and Amy’s comedic chemistry is infectious,” said Lorenzo Soria, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the TV and movie awards. “We can’t wait to see the dynamic duo return to the Golden Globes stage.”
