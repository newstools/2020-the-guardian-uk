Jimmy Kimmel devoted his entire show on Monday evening to honoring Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles’s beloved basketball legend who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday morning at age 41. “We don’t have a studio audience here tonight, because going forward with a comedy show didn’t feel right considering what happened yesterday,” Kimmel said. Instead, Kimmel paid an emotional tribute to Bryant’s 20-year career as a Los Angeles Laker and city figure with clips from his 15 appearances on the show over the years. Bryant died with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven friends traveling to his daughter’s basketball game, “and that was a punch in the gut for many of us,” Kimmel said. “He was just the last person you could ever imagine something like this happening to. He was so strong, and handsome, and smart, and energetic – he was a hero.” Kimmel clarified that he didn’t mean a hero like firefighters and first responders, “who actually save lives, I don’t mean to compare what he did for a living to what they do … But Kobe was a hero in the way Superman is a hero. He was so big it was almost like he was a fictional character. “Those of us who loved the Lakers know it seemed like he always came through, he always showed up to save the day,” Kimmel continued. “He wanted to save the day. He had a force of will. He never gave up.” Los Angeles loved him because he was supremely talented and worked harder than anyone, Kimmel said, “But we also loved him because he was ours.” Bryant came to LA as a teenager in 1996 and played 20 years for the Lakers, retiring in 2016 after helping win five championships for the city. Kimmel also touched on his personal relationship with Bryant, with whom he had “many conversations” off-camera over the years, ones that “always involved his daughters, always. Once he retired from basketball, his life revolved around their lives. He was very proud of them, he loved being a father.” “I know he was not a perfect person, I understand that. My intention is not to canonize him or make judgments about things I don’t know anything about,” Kimmel said, perhaps alluding to the 2003 sexual assault case against Bryant which was eventually dropped after the accuser declined to testify (Bryant and the accuser later reached a settlement in a civil case). “But I will say: he loved his family, he worked very hard, and he brought a lot of joy to a lot of people in this city, and we’re gonna miss him.” Trump’s defense complains about a lack of eye witnesses, but they’re the ones blocking the eye witnesses 🤔 pic.twitter.com/aMesAty66q On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah was back to business dissecting the latest in the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Monday’s arguments by Trump’s lawyers offered a defense that, said Noah, “basically boils down to this: one, this is just a political attack by the Democrats. Two, Trump did nothing wrong, and three, there are no firsthand witnesses who spoke to Trump about a quid pro quo.” The last point “is pretty ballsy”, said Noah, “because how are you gonna complain about having no eyewitnesses when you’re the ones blocking the eyewitnesses?” You can’t have it both ways, Noah argued. “It’s like if you’re a vegan, you can’t complain about all the chickpeas in your life. You chose that chickpea life.” The witnesses question is further complicated by news this weekend that Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, will release a book claiming Trump personally told him to withhold aid to Ukraine until he got information on Joe Biden – “which is the whole thing,” said Noah. “This is the heart of the entire impeachment thing. So I don’t know how Senate Republicans can justify not hearing from both sides. “Imagine, an eyewitness to a murder wanted to testify and the judge just refused.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers ticked through the list of evidence against Trump that has emerged since the impeachment trial. “You’ve got to give Trump credit,” said Meyers. “One crime isn’t enough for him. He’s always gotta do like five at once. He’s like a guy who steals a camcorder, sneaks into a movie theater without paying, illegally records and then sells the bootleg DVDs on the street, gets arrested, busts out of jail, and then holds a screening of the movie in a house he broke into.” For example, Meyers said, Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who Trump has claimed not to know, brought receipts attesting to Trump’s knowledge of the removal of US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in a deal for dirt on Biden. Parnas handed the US attorney’s office in New York secret taped footage of Trump telling Parnas to “get rid of her”, about Yovanovitch. “Get her out tomorrow. I don’t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.” “How is it possible that so many people have secret recordings of the president?” Meyers wondered. “I mean, this idiot has had more microphones and hidden cameras on him than Jim Carrey in the Truman Show.” Bolton’s book and Parnas’s receipts demonstrate “why it’s so crucial that the Senate vote to allow new evidence to be considered in the impeachment trial”, Meyers concluded, “because almost every day new evidence emerges”.
