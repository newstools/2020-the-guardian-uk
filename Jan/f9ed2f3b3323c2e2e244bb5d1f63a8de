David Brindle (Society, 8 January) is absolutely right to say that while the government obsesses endlessly about the NHS it almost totally ignores the crisis in social care. It is almost self-evident that health and social care are one and the same, and that both the budget and the administration for them must be unified. Until the responsibility for social care is taken away from local authorities and put into the hands of the NHS, the crisis will continue. Brindle – in common with most other commentators – refers to the social care crisis in relation to “the ageing population”. It is frequently overlooked that many people in need of social care services (eg those with learning difficulties, autism and related disabilities) are not “older people” but people of working age, many with severe and challenging difficulties. Such people are in grave danger of being forgotten altogether. On 13 December I wrote to my newly elected MP asking why there is so little sign of the government taking action on social care. I have yet to receive any response.
