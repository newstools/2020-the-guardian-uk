If Watford’s resurgence continues with a victory against Bournemouth they can climb out of the relegation zone, while pushing their opponents further into the mire, if Aston Villa lose against Manchester City. Nigel Pearson’s side were brilliant over the festive period earning 10 points from 12. Eddie Howe’s side are trending in the opposite direction with their huge injury list taking its toll. Bournemouth gained one point in the same set of four matches. Pearson will surely be hoping his side have the confidence to compound any January blues at the Vitality Stadium and continue building toward a comfortable finish come the Spring.
