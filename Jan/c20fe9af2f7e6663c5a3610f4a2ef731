The two-times London Marathon winner Wilson Kipsang has been provisionally suspended for whereabouts failures and tampering with samples, the Athletics Integrity Unit has announced. The Kenyan, who also won major marathons in Berlin, New York and Tokyo and is the only man to beat the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge over 26.2 miles, has been formally charged according to the AIU’s website. Under anti-doping regulations, athletes have to inform testing authorities of their whereabouts for a one-hour window every day and three failures – not being present at the said time within 12 months – lead to an automatic ban. The 37-year-old, who has a personal best of 2hr, 3min, 13secs, making him the equal sixth-fastest man in history, will face a hearing conducted under the rules of World Athletics Anti-Doping. Speaking in 2015, Kipsang said he believed that “maybe 99%” of the country’s athletes could be trusted. However, he has now become the latest high-profile Kenyan to come under suspicion. In 2017 Jemima Sumgong, whose Rio 2016 victory was Kenya’s first Olympic gold medal in the women’s marathon, was banned after testing positive for the blood-booster EPO. The former Olympic 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop has also tested positive for EPO, along with the former three-times Boston Marathon champion Rita Jeptoo. Between 2004 and August 2018, 138 Kenyan athletes tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, according to a Wada report published in September 2018. Last month Kenya said it planned to impose criminal penalties – including possible jail terms – on athletes caught doping by the summer of 2020 in a bid to get to grips with the problem.
