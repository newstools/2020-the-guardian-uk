Poster-style front pages abound this morning as the newspapers mark Britain’s looming departure from the European Union. The Daily Mail says it is “A new dawn for Britain”, with the headline running over an imposing picture of the white cliffs of Dover.

For the i, it’s not much a new dawn as potentially lights out for Britain. Its headline reads “UK’s leap into the unknown”, with a night time picture of Europe. The Independent wonders “Is it inevitable that we will one day rejoin?”.

The pro-leave Express trumpets a souvenir edition with a front page that has a collection of its Brexit-oriented front pages (there’ve been quite a few) photoshopped into a map of Britain. “Yes, we did it!” the splash headline says. Tomorrow's @Daily_Express #frontpage:- Yes, we did it! #BrexitDay #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/IXRz1gDgFs The Times eschews the poster-style front and instead goes with “PM wants Canada-style trade deal with Brussels”. THE TIMES: PM wants Canada -style trade really with Brussels #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/oPO8WvKuoL Telegraph has an interview with its sometime columnist Boris Johnson. Alongside a huge picture of the prime minister, the headline reads “This is not an end, but a beginning”. It also boasts an eight-page Brexit supplement.

"The Bank of England further downgraded its forecasts for the economy to the lowest level since the second world war"Front page of the FT tomorrow: pic.twitter.com/f66CeDPqxE The view from north of the border is rather different. The Scotsman says “Farewell, not goodbye” while the National says “Leave a light on for Scotland”. The Herald says “Hello, Goodbye”. Farewell, not goodbye. The front page of tomorrow's @TheScotsman on the day the UK - and with it, Scotland - leaves the EU. pic.twitter.com/o6NKYDpTmP The Mirror ignores the Brexit story opting for “Killer Flu: 150 Brits in quarantine”
