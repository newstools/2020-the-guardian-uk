Carlos Beltran is out as manager of the New York Mets before managing even a single game, the latest fallout from the Houston Astros’ sign-stealing scandal that has rocked Major League Baseball. The Mets announced the decision on Thursday in a news release, saying Beltran and the team “agreed to mutually part ways.” The move came two days after Boston cut ties with manager Alex Cora, who was Houston’s bench coach in 2017 when Beltran played for the Astros.

Next to fall was Beltran, the only Astros hitter mentioned by name on Monday when MLB issued its findings from an investigation into the club’s conduct. No players were disciplined, but the nine-page report said Beltran was among the group involved in the team’s illicit use of electronics to steal signs during Houston’s run to the 2017 World Series championship. “As a veteran player on the team, I should’ve recognized the severity of the issue and truly regret the actions that were taken,” said in a statement released on Thursday. “I am a man of faith and integrity and what took place did not demonstrate those characteristics that are so very important to me and my family. I’m very sorry. It’s not who I am as a father, a husband, a teammate and as an educator. The Mets organization and I mutually agreed to part ways, moving forward for the greater good with no further distractions. I hope that at some point in time, I’ll have the opportunity to return to this game that I love so much.”
