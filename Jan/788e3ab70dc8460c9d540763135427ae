Keir Starmer has vowed to lead the drive to stamp out antisemitism in the Labour party if he wins the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The shadow Brexit secretary, who is launching his leadership campaign in Manchester, said the party had not done enough to tackle the issue. Speaking on BBC One’s Breakfast programme, he said: “We should have done more on antisemitism. If you are antisemitic you shouldn’t be in the Labour party. “What I would do is lead from the top and say it’s my responsibility to deal with it. I wouldn’t say it’s for somebody else. I want the files, I want to know the numbers on my desk so that I can monitor this.” Starmer said he had argued within the party for tougher action. “I argued for automatic expulsion. It seemed to me that if you have been chucked out of the Labour party for supporting another political party, you should be chucked out for being antisemitic,” he said. Doreen Lawrence will introduce Starmer at his campaign launch at the Mechanics Institute in Manchester, the birthplace of the TUC. He will promise that his leadership bid will focus on defending radicalism, winning trust and becoming relevant. Before the official launch, he said: “We have to rebuild people’s trust in Labour as a force for good and real change. We have to take the fight to the Tories and make the case for how our values and ideas can deliver the change Britain so desperately needs.” According to the latest Labour figures, only Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry do not have the required 22 nominations from Labour MPs to reach the next stage of the process to replace Corbyn. Thornberry has 10 and Lewis has four. Starmer has 68, followed by Rebecca Long Bailey with 26, Lisa Nandy with 24 and Jess Phillips on 22.
