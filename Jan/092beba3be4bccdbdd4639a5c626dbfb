Tottenham have made their first move in the January transfer window by signing Benfica’s midfielder Gedson Fernandes. The 21-year-old has joined on an 18-month loan and there is an option for the deal to become permanent for a reported £56m. Fernandes becomes the club’s first signing of the José Mourinho era and will provide vital midfield cover following a three-month lay-off for Moussa Sissoko, who has had knee surgery. “I’m very happy to be here today – I make my dream a reality,” Fernandes said. “For me, it’s one big dream to come to this big club. I will try to give my best for the club every day, in every training session and in every game.” The Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen has told Internazionale that he wants to join them this month after the Serie A club started negotiations with Tottenham to sign the Denmark international, who is out of contract in six months. Inter have offered Eriksen a four-year deal, which would be extended by another six months if they can persuade Tottenham to sell the player this month. Inter have begun talks with Tottenham and have offered an initial €10m (£8.5m) but Spurs are holding out for twice that amount.
