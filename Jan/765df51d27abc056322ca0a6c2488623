New dawn, new day, new year. Feeling good about it. Things have turned, honestly. Though there is bound to be wind and rain, maybe snow, we will have an hour a day’s more daylight by the end of the month. The sun is moving, but not yet the temperature, though welcome frost will break up heavy soil. Try to keep off wet ground to avoid compacting it, but think about seed potatoes. This is the month to order your choices and lay them out in trays to chit. First earlies should be ready for planting in mid-March in warmer areas, but leave it until later where it is cooler. Look out for nearby potato fairs (potato-days.net) where you can also buy onion sets and shallots for planting in the coming months. Reacquaint yourself with a good garden centre. Order seed this month to avoid missing out on more interesting varieties. Support small suppliers if you can; organic if possible. You can maybe start off hardier seed in a propagator, or sow late-winter leaves if you have a cold frame. January is the time of the ‘hunger gap’, though kales and chards should still be good, and oriental leaves in more sheltered spots. Chicories, too – you can ‘force’ some styles now if you like; the same with well-established rhubarb sets. Cauliflowers should soon be ready and sprouting broccoli will start coming this month. Think about preparing new beds for the growing season, but avoid digging frozen soil. You can prune any apple and pear trees on warmer days without frost, but leave stone fruits such as plums until the summer. Compost any scattered leaves lying around and start hoeing new weeds while they are small. I had thought at first to say there is not much to do; to advise you to relax, luxuriate, plan your plot – so think about doing that, too. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.
