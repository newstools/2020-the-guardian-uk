Bring a pan of water to the boil. Peel a large carrot and cut into small pieces, about 3cm thick. Cook the carrot in the boiling water for about 8 minutes, until almost tender, then drain and set aside. Cut 150g of sweet, dark grapes in half, removing the seeds if necessary. Wash 150g of dark cabbage leaves and 4 large chard leaves and stalks. Roll up and finely shred the cabbage leaves. Remove the chard leaves from their stalks, then chop the stalks into pencil-thick slices. Roll the leaves up then cut them into thick strips about the width of a pencil. They will look like vegetable tagliatelle. Melt 40g of butter in a large, shallow pan, add 3 tbsp of olive oil then, when it is hot, add the cooked carrots, the chard stalks and shredded cabbage. Turn the vegetables over in the heat, until soft and gently sizzling, then add the grapes and chard leaves and continue cooking for 2 minutes, then add 50g of walnut halves. When everything is tender, pour in 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and toss gently then serve. Enough for 2. Once you start cooking, the dish comes together quite quickly, the ingredients added in fast succession, so I find it best to get the cabbage shredded, grapes halved and chard leaves and stalks chopped and ready beforehand. Once the balsamic vinegar is added and tossed with the vegetables, it is best to get the dish off the heat, as the dressing will burn quite easily. The sweet balsamic vinegar combines with the butter and cooking juices to make a dressing, but for a slightly more tart note you could add pomegranate molasses or vincotto. Instead of grapes, use sweet apples, cored and cut into thick slices or small cubes. Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater
