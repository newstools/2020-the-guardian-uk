A new study has suggested that one in six women suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of having an early miscarriage. The study of 650 women, conducted by Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium, found that almost a third of women showed symptoms of PTSD a month after the miscarriage and 18% at nine months. Others experienced anxiety and depression as a result. This raises the question of whether women are supported enough around early miscarriages. Given that most women do not share the news of their pregnancy until the 12-week scan, after which the risk of miscarriage reduces, many go through it without family, friends and colleagues knowing.
