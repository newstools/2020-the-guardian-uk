Manchester United have baulked at Sporting Lisbon’s £68m valuation of Bruno Fernandes, with their valuation of the midfielder closer to £38m plus add-ons. United will end their interest in the 25-year-old unless the Portuguese club move far closer to the fee United believe is realistic. In the summer Tottenham made an offer of £38m for Fernandes and Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the United manager, and the United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, view this as the baseline fee for him. There is also a view at United that should they agree to match Sporting’s valuation then this will greatly inflate any transfer fee demanded of the club for a player of similar quality in subsequent windows. It is also understood that recent reports saying a deal had been agreed were from sources wishing to apply pressure on United. While the two clubs are far apart on their valuation of Fernandes, Sporting’s financial problems could yet force their hand.
