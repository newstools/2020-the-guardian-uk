There was a time when not being able to eat gluten meant missing out on many of the best foods in life. These days, however, you can find all sorts of delicious gluten-free foods, from pizza to pasta. However, for home baking, my favourite gluten-free recipes are those that use common ingredients instead of specially prepared gluten-free substitutes. Made with ground almonds and polenta, this cake has firmness and body, and, bathed in a tangy blood orange syrup, is deliciously moist. Soaking the freshly baked cake in syrup is what keeps the polenta from being gritty. Make sure both the cake and syrup are warm before you do so; it won’t absorb as well if either are cold. Prep 20 minCook 50 minServes 8 For the cake150g unsalted butter, plus extra, melted, for greasing200g caster sugar250g ground almonds60g polenta3 large eggs½ tsp table salt1 ½ tsp baking powder For the candied zest80g caster sugar4 blood oranges, pared with a zester to give thin strips For the syrup60g sugar140g blood orange juice To make the cake, cream the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, then stir in the remaining cake ingredients. Pour the mix into a 2lb/900g loaf tin lined with greaseproof paper brushed with a little melted butter. Bake at 180C (160C fan)/gas 4 for 50 minutes, until golden brown. While the cake is cooking, make the candied zest. Mix the sugar and 120ml water in a small saucepan over a medium heat, until the sugar has dissolved. Tip in the zest and turn the heat to low. Simmer for about five minutes, until the zest becomes translucent, then remove with a fork and leave to cool. To make the syrup, pour the sugar and orange juice into the pan and boil for five minutes. When the cake is ready, poke holes all over the top with a skewer and pour over the syrup. Leave to cool before turning out of the tin and sprinkling over the candied zest.
