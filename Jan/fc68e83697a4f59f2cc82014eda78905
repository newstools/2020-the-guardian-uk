By sticking to the busy, touristy city centres, many visitors miss out on the local fun going on in the neighbourhoods. So if you’ve come across a colourful district away from the centre that shows the true character of a city, we want to hear about it. It might have great restaurants or markets or nightlife (and be better value than the city centre), a brilliant park or just a general air of friendliness. We’re only looking for European cities this time, not the UK. Please ensure your tip stays within around 100 words, and provide websites (and prices if helpful) and exact locations. Have a look at our past winners and other tips We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The prize is £200 for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has over 3,000 in the UK or Europe. The winner will be chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
