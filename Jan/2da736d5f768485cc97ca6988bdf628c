Passengers who arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan in China will be asked to enter through a separate area as a precautionary measure to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Other countries are putting their own safeguards in place and we’d like to hear from people who have been affected. We want to know about any additional measures you have encountered in airports in different countries following the coronavirus outbreak. Which airport were you travelling through and were people screened or asked to enter a different way? Do you feel that the measures were adequate? We are also interested in any general information you have about the virus. You can get in touch with us to share stories, pictures or video by filling in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information. You can also share via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.
