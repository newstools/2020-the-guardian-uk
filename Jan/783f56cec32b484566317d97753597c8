I first joined a hookup website in my early 60s, after two years’ membership of ordinary dating sites had failed to generate any interest in me. Over the years, I must have sent well over 100 messages without getting a response. At first, there was not much interest on the specialist site, either. Given my age, I wasn’t too surprised. Occasionally, however, a woman would initiate contact, and meetings would take place. I met two of them several times, but usually the meetings were one-offs. Things have changed over the last two years, following my 70th birthday. I have had six encounters with five different women, in age ranging from their mid-30s to late 50s. Three of the women had their husbands present, one for protection, while the other two filmed the encounter. I wasn’t excited or bothered; I just concentrated on the job in hand. I do not know why they find a man of my age attractive. On several different profiles, women have said that they’d like to meet a man in his 60s or 70s – so maybe the idea of an older man is a turn-on for them. It could be simply that I have posted more explicit photographs of myself on my profile. Either way, I am not going to complain; I am having more sex now than I did 50 years ago. I’m currently waiting to hear back from a man who wants me to have sex with his wife. I’d like to meet someone for something more long-term, but for now I’m enjoying myself. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours? Email sex@theguardian.com.
