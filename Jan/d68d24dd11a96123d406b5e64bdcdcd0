Pinatubo’s nine-length defeat of Armory in the Group One National Stakes at The Curragh last September has received official recognition as the finest performance by a two-year-old for a quarter of a century, as Charlie Appleby’s unbeaten colt was duly installed as 2019’s champion juvenile with a rating of 128, 2lb in front of the great Frankel at the same stage of his career. Like Frankel, Pinatubo completed his two-year-old campaign with a win in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket, but it was his earlier victories in both the National Stakes and the Vintage Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, by a combined total of 14 lengths, which sealed his status as one of the best juveniles for decades. “Pinatubo looked a potentially outstanding two-year-old when thrashing a competitive field in the Vintage Stakes,” Graeme Smith, the British Horseracing Authority’s lead two-year-old handicapper, said, “and his next performance in the National Stakes was breathtaking, the kind you rarely see in top company, as he powered nine lengths clear of Armory and Arizona in a top-class time. This was one of the great two-year-old performances, the best by any two-year-old in the last 25 years.” Pinatubo’s rating was 10lb in front of Earthlight (118), Andre Fabre’s Middle Park Stakes winner, and Kameko (Andrew Balding), who took the Vertem Futurity Trophy at Doncaster. Like Pinatubo, Earthlight is a son of the Darley stallion Shamardal, while Arizona (116), the runner-up in the Dewhurst, is one of only two juvenile from Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle stable among the 10 top-rated colts. Arazi (1991) and Celtic Swing (1994) are the only juveniles to receive a higher mark than Pinatubo since the European classification was first compiled in 1988. Xaar ended the 1997 campaign on 127, while Alhaarth (1995), Dream Ahead (2010), Frankel (2010), Hector Protector (1990), Johannesburg (2001), New Approach (2007) and Too Darn Hot (2018) were all rated 126. Frankel is the only one of these colts to go on to win the 2,000 Guineas the following spring, while only New Approach went on to win the Derby at Epsom. On the distaff side, 2019 was a triumphant season for Jessica Harrington, who is still most familiar as a Gold Cup-winning National Hunt trainer but is rapidly turning into a major player on the Flat too. Harrington is responsible not only for Cheveley Park winner Millisle (115), 2019’s top-rated juvenile filly, but also Albigna (114), who shares second place with Quadrilateral (Roger Charlton) and Raffle Prize (Mark Johnston). The handicappers have also been passing on their picks of three-year-olds that, they feel, will show significant improvement as the campaign develops. Last year’s picks, incidentally, included Skardu, who the Craven Stakes in April and then finished third in the Guineas, as well as Al Hilalee, who took the Group Two Prix Hocquart in France and Dubai Warrior (three wins from five, including a Listed event on the all-weather). But the list also included Chablis (no wins from nine starts), Quote (one maiden win from nine) and Dancing Vega (zero for three) so it’s fair to say this year’s bar has not been set too high. Smith nominates Waldkonig (John Gosden), Brentford Hope (Richard Hughes), Via De Vega (Andrew Balding) and Hukum (Owen Burrows), while Bird picks Alpine Star (Jessica Harrington), Even So, Chiricahua (both Ger Lyons) and Russian Emperor (Aidan O’Brien). Smith feels Brentford Hope could be worth running in a Guineas trial having won a Newmarket maiden by five lengths in October, while Via De Vega came from a very unpromising position to win on his debut at Sandown in September. Waldkonig, meanwhile, showed a remarkable turn of foot to win at Wolverhampton in December, while Hukum also made up plenty of ground to win a novice at Kempton. “He’s bred for middle-distances and looks every inch one for the Derby trials.” Mark Bird expects Alpine Star “to make up for lost time” after missing the second part of the season, while Even So “is very much one to look forward to over middle distances”. Russian Emperor “has the potential to emerge as one of the stable’s better three-year-olds this season”, while Chiricahua, who is still a maiden, “has a pedigree which suggests a nice blend of speed and stamina, and as a late April foal, he should be more race-savvy with some experience under his belt”. Colin Tizzard will take a small step along the same path as Harrington today when Padleyourowncanoe (2.20) goes to post for the stayers’ handicap at Lingfield. The six-year-old is a very rare runner for Tizzard on the Flat – only his seventh since 2004 – and while he has yet to welcome a winner on the level, today could be the day. Padleyourowncanoe is on a very fair mark just on his latest Flat outing back in September 2017, when he was second to a well-handicapped rival. Minella Rocco, the runner-up behind Harrington’s Sizing John in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in 2017, is an interesting runner in the hunter chase at Warwick, though Bob And Co (3.15), the likely favourite, is already second-favourite for the Foxhunter Chase at the Festival in March. Schiehallion Munro (2.30) will take plenty of beating in the feature event at Catterick Bridge, while Shine On Brendan (6.30) and Brigham Young (7.00) both have plenty going for them at Kempton.
