Two US service members were killed and two injured when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, the US military said on Saturday. In keeping with defense department rules, the military did not identify the service members. The Taliban immediately took responsibility for the attack. Qari Yusouf Ahmadi, a spokesman, said it occurred in the southern Kandahar province. More than 2,400 US service members have been killed in Afghanistan. Last year was one of the deadliest for the US even as Washington engaged in talks with the Taliban. The latest attack seemed certain to stall fresh efforts to restart the peace talks between Washington and the Taliban. US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been pressing the insurgents to agree to a ceasefire or at least reduce violent attacks. Earlier, Nato and Afghan officials confirmed a roadside bomb hit a US army vehicle, without mentioning casualties. In a short statement, a Nato spokesman said officials were still “assessing the situation and will provide more information as it became available”. An Afghan official said the attack had taken place in the Dand district of Kandahar province. The Taliban control or hold sway over roughly half of Afghanistan, staging near-daily attacks targeting Afghan and US forces, even as they hold peace talks. Scores of Afghan civilians are killed in the crossfire or by roadside bombs planted by militants. In November, two US service members were killed when their helicopter crashed in eastern Logar province. The US military at the time said preliminary reports did not indicate it was caused by enemy fire, though the Taliban claimed to have shot down the helicopter – a claim the US dismissed. US ambassador John Bass left Kabul last week, ending his two-year tenure as America’s top diplomat in the country.
