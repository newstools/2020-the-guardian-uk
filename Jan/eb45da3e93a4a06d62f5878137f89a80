The 2016 EU referendum result threw families, friends and couples into bitter conflict. As Brexit finally arrives, we want to hear from people who managed to heal those rifts, or move past them, or come round to a different point of view. We would also like to hear from you if the December general election result opened up new divisions in your family – did a parent, child or partner vote a different way to usual in the election? Whatever your age, background or where you live in the UK, tell us about how you overcame rifts with your family/friends caused by Brexit. We’d be very keen to hear from more than one person in the same family/couple/friendship group, if they had differing views. How did this Brexit rift impact your relationship? How did you heal the rift? Did the election open old wounds? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information if we decide to publish your response as part of an upcoming feature.
