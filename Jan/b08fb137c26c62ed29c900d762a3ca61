This collects several pieces of Warner’s short fantasy fiction, from 1929 to 1976. Each tale is a beautifully realised imaginative world, resonant with folklore and a rich appreciation of nature. The stories are full of characters – male and female – who don’t fit in with society’s expectations, like the eponymous protagonist of Lolly Willowes in her celebrated 1926 novel. Just as Warner offered Lolly an unexpected escape – to become a witch in the countryside instead of living with her dreary relations or marrying – here her narratives provide a wealth of surprising sidesteps from the bounds of convention. Humans can learn to “speak cat”; a nymph, masquerading as a seller of “stay-laces and suchlike female oddments”, vanishes from her male pursuer among the blackthorn bushes; and a baker’s weary daughter transforms, mid-song, into an owl. Better yet, those who are left behind – propagators of cruelty, greed, malice or ignorance – are made to suffer, such as Mr Poldero, who conspires to kill his “civil and obliging” phoenix to profit from the spectacle of its fire and rebirth, only to perish in the blaze. • Of Cats and Elfins is published by Handheld (RRP £12.99).
