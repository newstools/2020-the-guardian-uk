In 1981, the last Belle Vue Christmas Circus rolled up at Manchester’s Kings Hall. It had been a regular Christmas date since the 1920s: a traditional family circus with a ringmaster, band, tigers, bears and performing ponies, along with acrobats, strongmen and clowns. The Guardian photographer Don McPhee was there to take this picture of a woman being “kissed” by one of the circus’s horses as part of an act. McPhee, who was based in Manchester, began his career working for local newspapers before joining the Guardian in 1970. He died in 2007.
