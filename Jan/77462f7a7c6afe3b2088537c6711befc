The Women’s Super League meeting between West Ham United and Everton has been postponed after an outbreak of flu in the Hammers’ squad led to concerns over players’ welfare. The London club, currently eighth in the league, were due to host the Toffees on Sunday afternoon but the fixture has been called off in accordance with WSL rules. West Ham have apologised to fans for any inconvenience caused. An FA statement explained that the postponement was made due to “a widespread and severe flu virus that has affected a significant number of the West Ham United team”, adding that “player welfare is of paramount importance”. The date and time of the rescheduled fixture, to take place at the club’s Rush Green ground in Romford, will be decided “in due course”. It is not known which players are directly affected. Fans hoping to watch new defensive signings Filippa Wallen and Grace Fisk will have to wait for the London derby with Tottenham on 12 January.
