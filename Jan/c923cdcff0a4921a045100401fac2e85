I was pleased to see your report mentioning the need for better staffing for eating disorder community services (Report, 2 January). However, the analysis places too much emphasis on a lack of community services as the main reason for a steep increase in hospital admissions for eating disorders. We must not overlook the “causes of the causes” and instead recognise the sizable impact that social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have on the mental health of younger generations. As a millennial GP, with friends of a similar age, I feel particularly attuned to the negative effect certain influencers and celebrities can have on young people’s self-esteem and body perception. I have had consultations with young people where this has been a primary driver of body dysmorphia. Positive steps were made in the later part of 2019 when Instagram acted to ban “miracle” diet posts, but it is not enough. There are countless accounts where unqualified people give inaccurate and even dangerous advice on nutrition or weight-loss methods. Further steps need to be taken to regulate what is advertised on social media, and to promote diversity in our TV shows and films as well as public health campaigns to encourage a societal shift to end diet culture.Dr Stephanie Gounaris-ShannonNew Malden, London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
