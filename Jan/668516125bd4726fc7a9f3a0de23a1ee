The American rapper YG has been arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of robbery two days before he is scheduled to perform at the Grammy awards. Los Angeles county sheriff’s deputies took YG, whose real name is Keenon Jackson, into custody at his home in Chatsworth on Friday and also served a search warrant. He was held on $250,000 bail and released on bond shortly after 9pm, according to the sheriff’s website. The Compton rapper — whose hits include Toot It and Boot It and Go Loko — is scheduled to appear in court for an arraignment on Tuesday. Authorities did not provide additional details about the arrest or alleged robbery. YG and several other artists, including John Legend and Meek Mill, are due to perform a tribute to the rapper and activist Nipsey Hussle, who was shot dead in 2019, at the Grammys on Sunday.
