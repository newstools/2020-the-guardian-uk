Smoke from bushfires is likely to affect play in the third Test between Australia and New Zealand, which is set to begin on Friday at the Sydney Cricket Ground. More than 100 wildfires are currently burning in New South Wales, with air quality an concern for Sydney residents. The smoke is expected to be at its worst on Saturday and play could well be delayed, as was the case during a recent abandoned Big Bash League match in Canberra. Bushfires have killed 15 people this fire season, including four in the past 24 hours. Two people remain missing, more than 1,000 houses or buildings have been destroyed and about 2,500 firefighters, many of them volunteers, are battling the blazes. New Zealand bowler Will Somerville, who has lived in Sydney for most of his life, said any concern over the match were inconsequential to those who have been affected by the fires. “It’s bloody horrible, shocking, and it’s been going on for so long,” Somerville said. “I don’t know what more to say. There’s talk about smoke delaying this game but who cares, it doesn’t mean anything compared with what people are going through.” The Australia coach, Justin Langer, expressed similar sentiments, saying “a lot of people are suffering … our hearts go out [to them]”. Langer added that he would leave it up to others to monitor air quality and whether it was fit to play. “The reality is this is a game of cricket,” Langer said. “It will be the first time I’ll ever say this in my life, I hope it rains a bit during the Test, because Sydney needs it.” Any decision on whether to suspend play or abandon the match would rest with match referee Richie Richardson and the umpires, who will closely monitor air quality and visibility. Cricket Australia is in the midst of developing smoke protocols for future summers, in conjunction with the Australian players’ association. Current ICC protocols dictate that conditions are not hazardous until an air quality index of 300 is reached.
