New England Patriots star Julian Edelman was arrested in southern California on suspicion of misdemeanor vandalism after jumping on the hood of someone’s car, authorities said on Sunday. Edelman, 33, caused unspecified damage when he jumped on the vehicle on Saturday night in Beverly Hills, a police spokesperson said. Edelman was released on a citation and is scheduled to appear in court in April. The Patriots are yet to comment on the matter. On Saturday night former Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce posted a picture to Instagram of himself at dinner in Beverly Hills with Edelman and former Patriots receiver Danny Amendola. @edelman11 @dannyamendola y’all know what it is #bostonshit #champs A post shared by  The Truth (@paulpierce) on Jan 11, 2020 at 8:41pm PST Edelman, a wide receiver, made huge plays during the Patriots’ historic comeback against Atlanta in the Super Bowl following the 2016 season, which New England won 34-28. He won Super Bowl MVP honors in New England’s 20-17 victory last season against the Rams. Edelman led the Patriots during the 2019 regular season with 100 receptions, 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. But nagging injuries took a toll. He was mostly a non-factor in New England’s 20-13 wildcard upset loss to the Tennessee Titans last week.
