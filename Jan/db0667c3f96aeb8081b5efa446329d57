Radiohead have launched a new online archive of their work, called Radiohead Public Library, as well as releasing previously unavailable rarities to streaming services. Hosted at radiohead.com, the site features archival material grouped around each of the band’s nine studio albums, including music videos, live TV performances, artwork and the group’s quarterly w.a.s.t.e. newsletter series. It also links to the frequently bizarre, nightmarish and labyrinthine previous iterations of their website. “Radiohead.com has always been infuriatingly uninformative and unpredictable,” the band wrote on Twitter. “We have now, predictably, made it incredibly informative.” Visitors can create a downloadable library card, featuring a QR code that takes the holder to the website for data protection initiative GDPR. Out-of-print T-shirt designs from each era of the band’s history can be custom-made via the site. Each of the five band members will curate a selection of the archival material on their social media channels this week. The band have also uploaded songs that were previously unavailable on streaming services, including their first ever release, 1992’s Drill EP; the 2005 song I Want None of This from charity compilation Help! A Day in the Life; and the 2011 remix release Tkol Rmx 8. Streamable versions of the “office chart” playlists made by the band have also been collated.
