A man who is wanted in connection with the discovery of 39 bodies in a refrigerated container in Essex can be extradited from Ireland to the UK, a judge in Dublin has ruled. British authorities are seeking Eamonn Harrison, 23, from Mayobridge in Newry, County Down, on charges of human trafficking and immigration offences, as well as 39 offences of manslaughter, in relation to the discovery of the bodies in October last year. He is wanted for his alleged role in transporting the trailer in which the bodies of eight women and 31 men, all Vietnamese nationals, were found on an industrial park in Grays, Essex, in the early hours of 23 October. The court heard previously that Harrison is accused of 41 offences – 39 counts of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, one human trafficking offence, and one count of assisting unlawful immigration. He is alleged to have driven the container to the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium, and later signed the shipping notice for it. Mr Justice Donald Binchy said on Friday that, after hearing comprehensive arguments from both sides, he had decided to approve Harrison’s extradition. He said he had not published his judgment in full to the court and would not make it available until Monday. He added that it would not be helpful for him to try to summarise his decision to the court. The defence counsel Tony McGillicuddy said he would read the judgment next week and decide whether to appeal. Harrison was remanded in custody and will appear in court again on 4 February.
