For our first Interrail competition, we want your tips on the most scenic rail journeys in Europe (excluding the UK), whether it’s along a coast or river, through mountain passes, pretty villages or wilderness. To give you some inspiration, here’s our pick of 10 classic routes (please don’t send a tip about one of these). Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including useful websites and prices) in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and the winner will receive two first-class Interrail Global Passes from Eurail that allow for seven days of travel within one month, and are worth up to £384 each (depending on the age of the traveller).
