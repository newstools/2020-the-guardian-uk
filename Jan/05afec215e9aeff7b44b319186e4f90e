Borussia Dortmund’s new signing Erling Haaland scored a sensational hat-trick in 23 minutes on his debut to help his team come from two goals down and beat Augsburg 5-3 on Saturday as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. The Norwegian teenager Haaland, who joined weeks ago from RB Salzburg for a reported €20m, scored his first goal with a low drive in the 59th minute, three minutes after coming on, to cut the deficit to 3-2. Augsburg had led through a brace from Florian Niederlechner and a goal from Marco Richter. Jadon Sancho levelled for the visitors before Haaland then tapped in Dortmund’s fourth in the 70th to put them ahead. The 19-year-old then completed a memorable hat-trick in the 79th minute to seal their win. Fourth-placed Dortmund are now on 33 points. The leaders RB Leipzig, on 37 points, host Union Berlin later on Saturday. Bayern Munich, third on 33, travel to Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Ciro Immobile scored a hat-trick as Lazio hammered Sampdoria 5-1 on Saturday to record an 11th consecutive Serie A win and move to within three points of the leaders Juventus. A Felipe Caicedo strike and a double from Serie A’s leading scorer Immobile gave the hosts a decisive advantage after just 20 minutes. The substitute Bastos added a fourth in the second half before Immobile completed his hat-trick with his second penalty of the afternoon, taking his tally of league goals for the season to 23. Karol Linetty scored a consolation goal for Sampdoria with 20 minutes remaining, but their afternoon worsened four minutes later when defender Julian Chabot was sent off for a last-man challenge. Lazio have become just the fifth team in Serie A history to put together a winning run of more than 10 games, along with Juventus (four times), Roma (twice), Napoli and Internazionale. The result leaves the capital club in third place on 45 points, one behind Inter, who travel to Lecce on Sunday, and three adrift of the leaders Juve, who host Parma.
