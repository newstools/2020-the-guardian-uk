Harry Maguire will undergo a fitness test on his injured hip before Norwich City’s visit to Old Trafford, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær describing the Manchester United centre-back as a “warrior”. United believed earlier in the week that Maguire would be out for a prolonged period because of the severity of the problem yet he is determined to play. Solskjær said: “He’s got a chance for tomorrow. [It] was a minor thing; he will go through training today. He’s a warrior. At half-time [of Saturday’s draw with Wolves] he was feeling discomfort. But he was close to playing against [Manchester] City, just not fit enough, but he’s got a chance now.” Despite Tuesday’s 3-1 defeat by City in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg Solskjær would be keen to play them again immediately. This is despite Pep Guardiola’s team leading 3-0 at half-time after a near-humiliation of United in the opening 45 minutes. “Every game is a perfect opportunity,” the manager said. “If City were here next it would be a perfect opportunity. You play in front of the best fans in the world – what’s not to like?” Jesse Lingard has been ruled out of Norwich’s visit because he is feeling the effect of a recent illness. Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah are to play a reserve game against Newcastle on Friday evening as they continue their recovery from injury.
