A man and a woman have been charged with murder following the death of a two-year-old boy in Doncaster. Keigan Ronnie O’Brien was treated by ambulance staff following reports he was in cardiac arrest at a property in Adwick, Doncaster, on Wednesday, South Yorkshire police said. Police were called to the home at about 11am on Wednesday. Keigan was taken to hospital, where he died on Thursday afternoon. A postmortem showed he had died of head injuries. Martin Currie, 36, and Sarah O’Brien, 32, both from Doncaster, have been charged with murder and will appear at Doncaster magistrates court on Saturday. Flowers have been left outside the home and a birthday banner could be seen in the window. Reports said the family had just celebrated Keigan’s second birthday. David Brown, 54, who lives next door to the house, told the Doncaster Free Press: “We can’t believe this happened on our doorsteps. It’s shocking.” DCI James Axe said: “Specialist officers have updated Keigan’s family and are continuing to support them as they try to come to terms with and digest what has happened over the last 48 hours. “I would also like to please reiterate my request for people to be mindful of what they are posting across social media networks. “It’s really important to refrain from posting any speculative comments and details about the case, to avoid further distress to Keigan’s family and allow them the privacy to grieve, but to also allow the criminal proceedings to progress through the courts unhindered.”
