Barnsley have been hit with a Football Association charge after Stoke midfielder James McClean was allegedly the target of sectarian chants in the lead-up to Remembrance Sunday.

It is alleged that the club failed to ensure its spectators, and all persons purporting to be its supporters or followers, conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using abusive and/or insulting words which included a reference, whether express or implied, to nationality and/or religion and/or beliefs, while attending an EFL Championship fixture against Stoke City FC on Saturday 9 November 2019.” The FA is also investigation allegations of discriminatory chanting aimed at the Republic of Ireland international during his club’s 5-2 Championship win at Huddersfield on New Year’s Day, when a tannoy announcement was made to spectators.
