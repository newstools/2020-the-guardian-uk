Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We’ve been struggling a bit with Veganuary and need some tips from seasoned vegans. We both work and sometimes need pre-prepared or quick-to-make meals. What are the standout products, and which of the main supermarkets have the best ranges? We don’t want to spend a fortune. Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
