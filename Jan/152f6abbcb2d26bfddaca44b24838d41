Aston Villa and Newcastle are both considering signing Glenn Murray from Brighton on a short-term deal until the end of the season. The 36-year-old striker is out of contract at the Amex Stadium in the summer and has made just three Premier League starts so far this season under Graham Potter. With Brighton in the market for another forward this month having been linked with the CSKA Moscow striker Fyodor Chalov, it is understood that Murray would be allowed to leave if they can secure a replacement. That has alerted Villa’s Dean Smith and Steve Bruce of Newcastle, who are both keen to strengthen their attacking options in the January transfer window. Villa have also been linked with moves for Chelsea’s Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud having lost their record signing Wesley for the rest of the season to a knee injury, while Newcastle are hoping to provide more support for Joelinton and Andy Carroll. Nottingham Forest and Celtic have also shown an interest in signing Murray, who has scored 25 Premier League goals for Brighton since returning to the south coast permanently in January 2017. He missed the 1-0 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on Saturday because of injury, with Potter later admitting Murray would have played had he been passed fit. “It was unfortunate for him and unfortunate for us,” said Potter. “I think it would have been good for us to use him and it would have been good for him. But these things happen.”
