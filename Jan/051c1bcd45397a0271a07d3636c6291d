The news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be stepping back from their roles as senior members of the royal family has been met with shock, mischievous delight and plenty of blame around the world as the internet came to terms with “Megxit”. Amidst the sea of analysis from royal watchers and a somewhat frosty response from Buckingham Palace, Meghan – who moved from Canada to live with Prince Harry – became the focal point of attention, with Meghan and Megxit soon leading on Twitter around the world. Many expressed pleasure at the news, and applauded the independent streak shown by the couple in wanting to make their own way, and earn their own money. The Daily Show was among those offering the couple work in America. “We’re hiring,” their light-hearted message read. Requirements included “be very good at waving”. 🚨 WE’RE HIRING 🚨 pic.twitter.com/c7aJ6jjsS1 Others mused over what the now-part-time royal couple would do next, with Meghan again coming in for the most scrutiny. Some hoped she would play herself on Netflix’s The Crown. meghan markle in 2027 when she wins an emmy for playing herself in the crown season 8 episode about today pic.twitter.com/3WbpqUOwDx Live look at the Crown writers room pic.twitter.com/u2D1w8Yk69 Others poked fun at the couple’s skill-set, and wondered how they would earn a living in the real-world. Will Harry and Meghan start a YouTube channel now Very brave of Harry and Meghan to pick January as the month to go freelance. Among the jibes and quick takes, a lot of attention on Meghan suggested she was to blame for the couple’s decision, with some comparing her to Yoko Ono and her supposed role in breaking up the Beatles. “Duchess of deception” quickly trended on Twitter. “Did not foresee Meghan Markle supplanting Iran as the west’s greatest villain in the span of 24 hours,” wrote one Twitter user. Some commentators said the racist and personal attacks levelled against Meghan by the British tabloid press, which targeted her divorce and racial heritage, had made it impossible for her to build a life as a senior royal, and that Harry, after seeing how the press had tormented his mother, Princess Diana, has always had one foot out the door. “Good for Meghan and Harry opting out of the UK tabloids’ staggering racism and the lack of support from the royal family,” tweeted writer Roxane Gay. “They will be fine” “Meghan deserves peace,” tweeted UK writer and speaker Toni Tone. “British press and too many British people have vilified her when she has done nothing but live her life. I don’t blame her or Harry for making the decision they have made. Also, kudos to Harry for supporting his wife and the wellbeing of his family.” Anyway...

A little great news when all the other news is horrible is especially sweet, don’t let anyone steal your joy on this, the day we will commemorate each year as Megxit.
