Red Star Belgrade have confirmed they intend to apply to the Rugby Football League for a place in League 1, possibly as soon as 2021. The Serbian club played in the Challenge Cup in 2019 and say they are now in the process of raising sufficient investment in order to submit their bid to enter the league. In a statement the club said: “Red Star Belgrade have held general discussions and believe there is strong potential for our bid once it is formally submitted. We love the game of rugby league and want to see it rise in popularity. We hope to be a model of future expansion across Europe.” The RFL has already given the go-ahead for New York and a relocated Hemel club based in Ottawa to enter League 1 in 2021.
