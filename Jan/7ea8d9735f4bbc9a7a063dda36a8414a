I am as in touch with my inner six-year-old as the next person, but I nevertheless rejoiced when I thought you had moved on from Kim-Joy bakes (G2, 16 January) but no, she is back and offering us lemon tarts decorated with emoji. Honestly, it’s fine; I am happy to eat cake without a face.Julia DraperBath • My daughter and I were surprised to see Kim-Joy’s column interrupted by David Atherton’s “fit food” (G2, 9 January). His flapjacks could definitely be improved by icing cute faces on them ;-).Frances and Juliet ClarkTwickenham, London • Refilling is nothing new (Asda store to offer big brands in bring-your-own refill containers, 16 January). In Burgundy in the 1980s I remember being able to refill empty bottles from a barrel of local wine at a rural supermarket.Janet JolleyHarpenden, Hertfordshire • I’ll be smoking a Big Ben bong to dull the pain of being a citizen of the second most stupid country in the world (Downing St kills off the Brexit bells, 17 January).Denny PlowmanWest Bridgford, Nottingham • A mere 77-year-old making a piffling 15lb of marmalade (Letters, 17 January), I accidently sliced into my finger, and as I am on blood thinners and was alone in the house, I did have doubts whether I might not get to the end of the process, or the process might outlive me.Deb MastersPortchester, Portsmouth • I can’t compete in the marmalade-making stakes, but do wonder how much might fit into a 35mm film canister.Patrick WallaceLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
