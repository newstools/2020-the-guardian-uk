Last year Instagram announced that it would ban all graphic self-harm images as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of the British teenager Molly Russell.The photo-sharing platform made the decision after being met with a tide of public anger over the suicide of a 14-year-old girl, whose Instagram account contained distressing material about depression and suicide.A year on, we want to hear your views on how the platform has improved the situation for people. Are images of self-harm still visible via private accounts? Are certain hashtags used to unearth such images? Has the ban helped? What other areas need to be addressed? How do you feel about the support that is offered via the platform? We want to hear your thoughts on this. Please get in touch via the encryptedform below.
