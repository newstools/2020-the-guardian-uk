Sympathy is extended to Day6 fans who arrive too late to bag a spot at the front of the queue. By 7am on Sunday, 100 determined MyDays – the collective fan name – are already in place outside Brixton Academy, and will have the choicest view of the five-man K-rock outfit when the show starts, 12 hours later. But even the tardiest MyDays, still trailing in when Day6 kick off with the dual shoutalongs, Best Part and Sing Me, are rewarded with a performance that’s both frenetic gig and mass self-affirmation exercise. And there’s the primary difference between the Seoul-based pop-rockers and the western guitar bands they admire, who include the Strokes and Kodaline. Any group can punch out a sharp, hooky set, but Day6’s show – only their second UK appearance – positions them as both purveyors of slugging powerpop and watchful older brothers. “We’re here to make you guys feel better,” bassist/rapper Young K tells the lovestruck MyDays, a sentiment echoed by California-bred guitarist Jae, who speaks at length about his own “dark places”, concluding: “Live your own life, you got me?” Unlike most South Korean boybands, Day6 write and play instruments, and seize the chance to show off individually with twiddly solos. But it’s as tousled, scissor-kicking brothers in arms that they excel. With a setlist spanning their nine albums and EPs and a bank of cannons primed to shower confetti, they compress two hours into a ball of energy that makes them naturals for festival bills. It’s immaterial that nearly everything apart from a cover of Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You is sung/rapped in Korean: empathy and “sweet chaos” – a song title that aptly describes this show – carry the day.
