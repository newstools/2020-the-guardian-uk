The impeachment trial of Donald Trump resumes on Monday with the president’s defence team’s main presentations in the US Senate. Here’s what’s coming up: Monday: Donald Trump has no plans to appear at his own impeachment trial. His defence team will begin their main arguments today, after a short curtain-raiser at the weekend. Ken Starr, who prosecuted the case against Bill Clinton at his impeachment trial (in which Clinton was acquitted), is now a presidential defender and could begin his presentation as early as today. Tuesday: The Trump defence team has more time today to complete its presentations, if it chooses to take all the time allocated to it. Wednesday: Trump’s team has the right to raise objections against specific elements of the impeachment case and could use today to do it, perhaps followed by the start of Senators’ questions. Thursday: Senators can ask questions for a total of 16 hours spread over two days, submitted in writing only, to the presiding judge, supreme court chief justice John Roberts. This will be followed by a debate that could kick off today or more likely tomorrow, on whether to bring fresh witnesses and documents to the trial. Friday: The debate on witnesses could begin or continue today, followed by the crucial vote on that topic. Saturday: If the Senate votes to hear new witnesses and evidence then the trial will go on for much longer. If, more likely, Democrats lose that vote, expect closing deliberations and a final, monumental, vote on whether to remove Donald Trump from office or acquit him of the charges some time Monday (the date of the Iowa caucuses) or Tuesday (when Trump has expressed the hope to be in the clear in time for his State of the Union address that night).
