Arabic coffee is made from gold roasted arabica beans that are ground and spiced with cardamom, and sometimes with saffron and cloves, too – look for it in Middle Eastern food stores, or buy online. Failing that, make it at home by roasting green coffee beans in a pan until golden, then grinding them with spice to suit your tastes. It has a very distinctive flavour that works beautifully in this reimagined version of the Irish classic. Serves 1 50ml Arabic coffee 15ml coffee liqueur – we use Kahlúa15ml whiskey – we use Jameson, but any blended whiskey will do 10ml sugar syrup (a 2:1 sugar:water ratio is best here)40ml double cream 5ml rose water Rose petals, to garnish Brew the coffee as normal, then pour the coffee, coffee liqueur, whiskey and syrup into a heatproof glass. Combine the cream and rose water in a shaker, shake, then pour over the cocktail mix. Garnish with rose petals and serve. • Jonas Stern, head bartender, Nutshell, London WC2.
