Mbwana Samatta could be set to become the first Tanzanian player to move to the Premier League, with Brighton, Crystal Palace and Norwich all interested in signing the striker from the Belgian champions, Genk, during the January transfer window. Samatta, who scored in Genk’s Champions League defeat by Liverpool in November, has a €10m release clause in his contract which expires at the end of next season with all three English clubs understood to have been closely monitoring his progress this season. Having moved to Belgium from TP Mazembe in 2016, the 27-year-old finished as top scorer in Belgium last season and became the first east African to win the coveted Soulier d’ébène award for the best African or African origin player in the Belgian Pro League. Eintracht Frankfurt and Lazio have also expressed an interest in signing Samatta this month, although it is believed he would prefer to play in a league which is closely followed in Tanzania. Brighton are thought to be the frontrunners at this stage, with the manager, Graham Potter, looking to provide attacking support for Neal Maupay amid interest from Aston Villa and Newcastle in the 36-year-old Glenn Murray. Norwich are also keen to provide back-up to their leading scorer, Teemu Pukki, as they try to avoid relegation, while the continued absence of Christian Benteke through injury means Palace are in the market for another striker. Roy Hodgson’s side have also made their interest known in the Strasbourg defender Mohamed Simakan, as have Southampton and Watford, although the €25m valuation of the teenager is considered far too high at this stage of his career.
