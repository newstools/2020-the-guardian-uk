In 2017, Ghent introduced its circulatieplan (circulation plan) which removed traffic from the city centre using car-free zones. Since then there has been more space for pedestrians and cyclists with only a select group of vehicles such as emergency services, trams, buses and taxis able to enter. Though the historic centre of Ghent has been car free since 1997, the circulatieplan has expanded on this by diverting vehicle traffic away from the centre via a ring road. Cities like Birmingham are planning on following in its footsteps. Whether you live or work in Ghent, we would like to hear from you. How has the city changed since the 2017 plan was implemented? How does it feel now compared to before? What advice would you give to other towns and cities hoping to achieve something similar? We are also interested in any photos you have taken of what the city looked like before and after. You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below.
