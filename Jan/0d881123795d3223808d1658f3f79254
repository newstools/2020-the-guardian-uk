Billie Eilish will write and sing the theme song to No Time to Die, the 25th film in the James Bond franchise. At 18 years old, she is the youngest musician ever to provide the soundtrack to a Bond film. Eilish said in a statement: “It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honour. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I’m still in shock.” As with her debut album, 2019’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, Eilish wrote the titular song alongside her older brother and co-producer Finneas. He said that the siblings had always dreamed of writing the theme to a Bond film. “There is no more iconic pairing of music and cinema than the likes of Goldfinger and Live and Let Die. We feel so so lucky to play a small role in such a legendary franchise, long live 007.” Film producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said that Eilish’s song had been “impeccably crafted to work within the emotional story of the film”. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga described himself as a huge fan of Eilish and her brother: “Their creative integrity and talent are second to none and I cannot wait for audiences to hear what they’ve brought – a fresh new perspective whose vocals will echo for generations to come.” Eilish is the latest sign of the Bond franchise’s modernisation. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was hired to liven up the script at the request of star Daniel Craig. Industry publication Variety described the hiring of Fukunaga, known for directing the films Sin Nombre and Beasts of No Nation, and TV’s True Detective, as a “stunning and risky move”. Hans Zimmer was recently drafted in as a last-minute replacement to score No Time to Die. He replaced Dan Romer, who departed due to creative differences with the film’s production company Eon Productions. No Time to Die is released in the UK on 2 April.
