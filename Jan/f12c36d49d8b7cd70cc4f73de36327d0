There’s a rare unanimity of thought when saxophonist Stan Sulzmann and pianist Nikki Iles play together. The way they latch on to one another’s ideas is often surprising but never at cross purposes. They have held these elegant and good-humoured conversations on two previous albums, and this time, with the addition of bassist Dave Holland, the duo becomes a trio. Holland’s inventiveness and warm, resonant tone make for a perfect fit. The result is music that’s a joy to follow, partly because it’s clear and well modulated – none of that everyone-shouting-at-once that puts would-be listeners off. I particularly enjoyed a version of Who Can I Turn To?, in which the original melody drifts briefly in and out during the course of about eight minutes. Fresh ideas are passed around, tossed and turned, until finally being brought gently back to earth. It’s exhilarating, and the same goes for all nine tracks here. In fact the album is pretty impressive from all points of view, not least the quality of the recording, which manages to convey an atmosphere of friendly intimacy along with the music.
