Re your article (Researchers crack question of whether couples start looking alike, 12 October), now in my 93rd year and having been married for 71 years, I find it amazing that none of the quoted scientists have thought to look at couples’ pictures on their wedding day. For many years, I have always commented on how many couples look alike.

My husband and I would support this theory – it certainly proved a good choice for us.Joan CarterTorrington, Devon • Like Zoe Williams (I’m a middle-aged pacifist – so why do Rishi Sunak and co want me to join the army?, 9 October), I completed the government’s careers questionnaire.
