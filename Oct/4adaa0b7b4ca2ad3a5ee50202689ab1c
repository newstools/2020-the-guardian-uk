Halloween is coming, but beyond the pumpkins, ghoulish costumes and buckets of sweets, we want to delve deeper into the myths, mysteries and traditions of this festival marking the end of the season of light and beginning of the dark days of winter. Tell us about your favourite spooky site in the UK, be it a cursed castle, a place with a horrible history, a macabre tour or the setting for a literary horror story. Please check the site you choose is currently open before submitting a tip. If you have taken a great photograph, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 13 October at 9am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
