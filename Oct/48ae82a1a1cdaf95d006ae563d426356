The Azerbaijani ambassadorâ€™s reference to Nagorno-Karabakh (Letters, 1 October) needs correction. Indeed, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) is not one over a disputed territory but about the issue of self-determination and fundamental human rights, including the inalienable right of Armenians of Artsakh to live freely and peacefully on the land of their ancestors. Nagorno-Karabakh has never been a part of independent Azerbaijan, as its people voted for independence in full compliance with the norms of international law and existing domestic legislation and according to the same legal basis as Azerbaijan in 1991. The key to lasting peace in the region is the recognition of the human security and rights of the people of Artsakh. Instead, on 27 September Azerbaijan initiated another large-scale military aggression against Nagorno-Karabakh with the support of Turkey.Aram AraratyanPress officer, Armenian embassy, London
