Raheem Sterling is expected to be fit for Saturday’s visit of Arsenal to Manchester City after being forced to withdraw from the England squad due to a hamstring injury. Sterling’s progress will be a relief to Pep Guardiola as City’s manager has fielded the 25-year-old at centre-forward to deputise for the long-term injured Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus. With Kevin De Bruyne also sent home by Belgium on Monday as a precaution the manager’s ability to call on his two most important senior players appeared in the balance. The Belgian is to be monitored as the week progresses. Sterling is City’s top scorer this season, having registered three times in five games in the league and EFL Cup. He also has two assists. City have four points after three games, having failed to win since their season opener at Wolves.
