Melbourne Cup-winning trainer Darren Weir has been committed to stand trial on conspiracy charges stemming from the 2018 spring racing carnival. A magistrate ruled there is enough evidence for a jury to find Weir, his then-assistant Jarrod McLean and then-stablehand Tyson Kermond conspired to cheat and defraud racing stewards. The trio are accused of horse torture, including the use of a shock device or “jigger”, on Cup runner Red Cardinal, and Cup hopefuls Yogi and Tosen Basil, during an alleged illicit training regime. Magistrate Ron Saines on Monday concluded there was enough evidence for a jury to find the three men were present when an “unauthorised electric device” was used on the horses at Warrnambool a week before the 2018 Cup. Weir pleaded not guilty in an online sitting of Ballarat magistrates court to two counts of conspiracy and two firearms offences. McLean pleaded not guilty to two counts of conspiracy, seven betting offences and a single drugs charge. There was not enough evidence to support allegations McLean gave retired jockey William Hernan corrupt information for the purposes of betting on Red Cardinal. That charge was dismissed. It meant Hernan was cleared of the single charge against him of corrupt betting. Kermond pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy charges. Related animal cruelty charges against the Weir, McLean and Kermond will also be dealt with by a judge.
