AC/DC have announced a reunion, featuring members who had left the classic rock band in recent years. A new post on their Instagram account depicts vocalist Brian Johnson, bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd, all of whom had previously departed. Johnson had been the band’s frontman since 1980, following the death of original singer Bon Scott, but had quit in 2016 due to hearing loss; Williams retired in 2017. It’s Rudd’s third stint in the Australian band, first playing from 1975 to 1983, then rejoining in 1994. In 2015 he was sentenced to eight months’ house arrest after being charged with drug possession and threatening to kill his personal assistant. He was replaced by former AC/DC drummer Chris Slade. ARE YOU READY? #PWRUP ⚡ A post shared by  AC/DC (@acdc) on Sep 30, 2020 at 5:00am PDT The three returning musicians are joined by uncle-and-nephew guitarists Angus Young and Stevie Young, who had remained in the lineup. Stevie replaced Angus’s brother Malcolm in 2014, after Malcolm was diagnosed with dementia. Malcolm Young died in 2017. No new album or tour has been announced with the returning lineup, but the Instagram post’s Pwr Up caption suggests an album of the same name. The band’s previous album was Rock or Bust in 2014.
