Iconic cultural organisations and venues known around the world, such as the London Symphony Orchestra, Liverpool’s Cavern Club, and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, will benefit from a share of £257m in emergency pandemic funding distributed today by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. But many UK venues who have not been successful face a bleak winter. Leaders in the night-time economy have already launched a legal challenge over lockdown rules which they say will have a “catastrophic impact” on late-night businesses; the ongoing lack of touring, the drop in cinema visits and the need for social distancing in venues all mean that without targeted government support, venues and arts organisations will struggle to survive.If you work for an arts organisation or venue who was unsuccessful in their bid for government funding – or were deemed ineligible in the first place – we want to hear from you about the government’s decision, your fears for the future, and how the UK arts sector will be able to survive this crisis.
