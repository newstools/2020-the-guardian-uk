The Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been mocked for his attempt to explain why he could not produce some documents he had promised relating to Joe Biden. He said the only copy of the papers, which he claimed added to claims about Bidenâ€™s son Hunter, had been lost. In a segment delivered to camera, Carlson said: On Monday we received from a source a collection of confidential documents related to the Biden family. We believe those documents are authentic, theyâ€™re real, and theyâ€™re damning â€¦ We texted a producer in New York and we asked him to send those documents to us in LA â€¦ He shipped those documents overnight to California with a large national carrier brand â€¦ But the Biden documents never arrived in Los Angeles. Tuesday morning we received word from the shipping company that our package had been opened and the contents were missing. The documents had disappeared.

They used pictures of what we had sent so that searchers would know what to look for. They went far and beyond. But they found nothing, those documents have vanished. As of tonight the company has no idea â€“ and no working theory even â€“ about what happened to this trove of materials, documents that are directly relevant to the presidential campaign. Carlsonâ€™s show has been one of the main conduits of conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden, attempting to expand the narrative about his dealings in Ukraine and China and castigating other media outlets for not paying enough attention to claims made recently in the New York Post. Carsonâ€™s story of the lost documents cut little ice on social media: BREAKING: Documents Tucker Carlson never actually had that would allegedly blow up the election were so important that they were sent via DHL, and now canâ€™t be found despite copiers, iPhone cameras and security cameras. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/9yKkDAUh2v did you check underneath Trumpâ€™s healthcare plan https://t.co/Ec9PBvdBRu Like Tucker, I also send my super secret documents through the mail and fail to make a copy. https://t.co/QFNgRGBjPz
