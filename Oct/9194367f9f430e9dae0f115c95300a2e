The Covid death toll across the UK has surpassed 60,000 for the first time, hitting 61,116, according to analysis of official data. The total number of deaths registered by the three statistical agencies across England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland now stands at 59,927. But more up to date government figures show that 1,189 deaths have occurred within 28 days of a positive test since the figures were registered in each nation: 1,044 in England, 62 in Scotland, 47 in Wales and 36 in Northern Ireland. This brings to 61,116 the number of deaths across the four nations of the UK. There were 670 Covid-19 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to 16 October, data from the ONS released on Tuesday shows. This is an increase of 53% on the previous week, when 438 deaths were reported, and indicates the widespread increase in new coronavirus cases is leading to an increase in fatalities. The number of deaths registered in England and Wales continues to double every fortnight, from 139 in the week ending 18 September to 321 two weeks later and 670 today. Deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals as a proportion of all deaths in hospitals increased from 8.4% in week 41 to 12.0% in week 42. Covid-19 deaths increased across all English regions but were highest in north-west England, where there were 229 deaths. The number of deaths from all causes in hospitals remained below the five-year average, but deaths in private homes remained high, with 776 excess deaths. Care homes reported 90 more deaths than the five-year average.
