Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove the thick stalks from 2 very large (or 4 medium) field mushrooms, then put the mushrooms gill side up on a baking tray. Score the inside of each mushroom with a kitchen knife in a lattice pattern. Pour a generous tbsp of olive oil into each. Crush 2 large, peeled cloves of garlic to a paste, then pound in 4 tbsp of olive oil, 2 tsp of ground sumac, the juice of half a small lemon and a little salt. Drain a 400g tin of chickpeas then mash half into the garlic paste to a thick, coarse purée. Stir in 2 tbsp of tahini paste, a tbsp of thyme leaves and 2 tsp of sesame seeds. Fill the mushrooms with the chickpea paste then cover each with the reserved whole chickpeas. Finally trickle a little olive oil over each one and scatter with a further 2 tsp of sesame seeds. Bake for 30 minutes. Serves with a crisp salad or perhaps rice. Enough for 2. The perfect mushrooms for this are the very large, deeply cupped field or portobello variety. Use smaller ones if that is what you have and adjust the cooking time slightly. Scoring the mushrooms deeply with a sharp knife will allow the olive oil to penetrate deep into the flesh of the mushroom. The chickpea and tahini stuffing can be used to fill peppers instead. Halve, deseed and roast a couple of red peppers then fill them as you would have done with the mushrooms. I also like this purée spread thickly on toast, the chickpeas scattered on top.
