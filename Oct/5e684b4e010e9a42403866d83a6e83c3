Becoming a parent can be overwhelming and stressful at the best of times, let alone in the middle of a global health crisis. Following on from her Modern Masculinity series, Iman Amrani wants to open up a conversation about fatherhood and mental health. Did you feel daunted or anxious after the birth of your child? How did you handle this? Both mothers and fathers can have postnatal depression. If your mental health was affected after becoming a parent, would you be willing to speak about it? Do you think there is enough support available for men struggling with parenthood? What advice would you give to other new fathers?
