Winter is coming but that doesn’t mean we can’t still enjoy the great outdoors. With the right gear – and proper planning and safety precautions – the UK can be a beautiful and inspiring place in winter. And you may even have stunning locations that are packed in summer all to yourself. We want to know about your favourite winter adventures and activities – hill walking, wild swimming, camping, kayaking, fell running, even surfing – and where and how you do them, including useful websites and practical details. If you have taken a great photograph, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and maybe the paper too. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 20 October at 9am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
