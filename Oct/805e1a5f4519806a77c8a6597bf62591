José Mourinho’s bid to bundle Dele Alli out of the back door of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has hit a snag. Paris Saint-Germain are willing to take the unwanted star off his hands, but are only willing to stump up a £1.5m loan fee. Daniel Levy isn’t so green as he’s cabbage looking, and wants more coin. PSG might come back with an increased offer. They also might not. The Parisians may instead concentrate their efforts on Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar, which would irritate Arsenal greatly, on account of their long-standing serious interest. The Gunners are committed enough to the idea of Aouar to have already agreed to ship Lucas Torreira to Atlético Madrid. Unfulfilled talents Demarai Gray and Xherdan Shaqiri are both strangely up for sale. Possible destinations are yet to be identified, but in lieu of solid news/interest, the Rumour Mill suggests Leicester City and Liverpool could do worse than talk to each other. Bayern Munich are in again for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Chelsea may also offload Marcos Alonso to Internazionale and Antonio Rüdiger to Tottenham, Frank Lampard continuing to reshape that defence in his own inimitable style. Fulham‘s bid for Championship football could take a blow with the purchase of two competent central defenders. Jean-Clair Todibo of Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven’s Timo Baumgartl are the men in question. And with deadline day looming, Ed Woodward is quickly running out of time to placate Manchester United‘s aggravated transfer-starved fanbase. A deal for Atalanta winger Amad Traoré might do it, helped along by the £20m they’ll trouser from Roma for Chris Smalling.
