Fans of Lana Del Rey have criticised her for wearing a glittery mesh mask that did not appear to fully cover her nose and mouth at a surprise poetry reading and book signing event. The musician read from her new collection, Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass, and posed with fans at a Barnes and Noble store in Los Angeles at the weekend, wearing a net facial covering that did not seem to assist in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. After Del Rey posted images of herself wearing the mask to her Instagram account, fans accused the 35-year-old of being irresponsible and begged her to wear a proper facial covering.

The Guardian has contacted representatives for the singer for comment. Del Rey‚Äôs sister, Chuck Grant, claimed that the star had ‚Äútested negative‚Äù and always remained six feet away from fans. Yet several fans shared photographs from the event depicting them standing next to and touching Del Rey. Combined with other preventative measures such as hand washing and social distancing, wearing face masks protects against the spread of coronavirus by acting as a barrier between the wearer and other individuals. At the Los Angeles event, Del Rey told fans that she planned to release her forthcoming album, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, in December or the following month. Her last album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, was named 2019‚Äôs album of the year by multiple publications, including the Guardian.
