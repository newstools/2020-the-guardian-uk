This is the first time that I have seen “Trump” and “positive” in the same sentence (Trump and first lady Melania test positive for coronavirus, 2 October). Hopefully after he and Melania do their time in isolation, they will come out healthy, and with a greater understanding of this pandemic and the value of masks and social distancing. Mask up and keep your distance, please.Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourne, Australia • I wonder if Donald Trump has lost his sense of taste after his diagnosis. If he has, how would we tell?Mike PenderCardiff • On Thursday, I received the licence fee request and the same day read that Andrew Marr reminds himself regularly that people who pay include those “who voted for Ukip … passionate members of Momentum and everything in between” (Andrew Marr: ‘There is a drive on to destroy the BBC’, 30 September). He therefore feels a responsibility of fairness to all. That journalistic integrity and inclusivity is why I happily pay to support the BBC and feel lucky to do so.Liz ByrneLetchworth, Hertfordshire • Re Chris Birch’s letter (1 October), I’m in my very late 70s, a bright young thing, and have no idea what streaming and Netflix are. I’m sure our wealth of life’s experiences will account for more.Jean JacksonSeer Green, Buckinghamshire • Peter Dilloway hopes Boris Johnson will lead the way in training for a new job (Letters, 30 September). It would good if he could practise being better at his current one.Michael CunninghamWolverhampton
