Around the world, Covid lockdowns have led to improvements in air pollution. In northern India, the Himalayas were visible in the distance for the first time in a generation. And during the first nine weeks of the UK lockdown, nitrogen dioxide along London’s roads decreased by an average of 31% compared with the pre-lockdown period. Non-essential shops in the capital reopened on 15 June but life and traffic pollution have still not returned to normal. Compared with 2019, decreases of more than 40% have been measured along roads in the City of London and Westminster, including the Strand and West End. What are the best policies to reduce air pollution? Most air pollution is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and waste, and this is the focus of the World Health Organization’s global recommendations: In the UK, the government’s extensive research shows deterring polluting vehicles from city and town centres is by far the quickest, most cost-effective way to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which are at illegal levels in most urban areas. Other policies include: What are the best ways to avoid air pollution? The solution to air pollution is stopping it at source but until that happens, experts including the British Lung Foundation (BLF) suggest the following:  This builds on the improvements from London’s ultra-low emission zone. But there are emerging signs of a return to pre-lockdown pollution on some suburban roads. The town of Horley, north-east of Gatwick, has recorded a 60% reduction in residential areas close to the airport fence and about 40% in a nearby children’s playground. UK government measurement equipment near Heathrow detected a 46% improvement. The biggest reduction was 64%, recorded near the entrance to the Beech Street tunnel, which is closed to diesel and petrol traffic. • Thanks to Timothy Baker, Louise Mittal and Anna Font, London Air and Imperial College London for discussion and coding assistance.
