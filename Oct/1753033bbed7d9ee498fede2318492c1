I am a heterosexual woman of nearly 30, who had never had an orgasm with a partner until recently. I could achieve one alone, but thought I was psychologically unable to do so with another person. I was resigned to faking it. A few months ago, I took up daily yoga to cope with the change of pace during lockdown. Soon I was connecting with my body in a way I’d not experienced before. I enjoyed experimenting with my breath. I became aware of every muscle, and began to understand the interplay between these two elements: breath and muscles. One night, I surprised myself by having an orgasm during sex with my partner. My daily yoga proved to be just what I needed to step outside my head and allow myself to trust the moment. Since then, I feel as if I have unlocked something deep within myself. I now have an orgasm every time we have sex. I also have a renewed interest in intimacy, sex and pleasure. I assumed these things were not on the cards for me. So if you’re struggling to climax, why not try yoga, too. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?
