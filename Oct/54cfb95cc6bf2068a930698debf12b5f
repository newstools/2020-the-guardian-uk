Our margarita doesn’t feature triple sec or orange liqueur, which makes it a cleaner drink more like the ones they have in Mexico. Use a decent white tequila, rather than an aged one – something like Ocho or Tapatio will do the trick nicely – because it suits the drink’s profile much better. Serves 1 50ml white tequila25ml freshly squeezed lime juice, plus 1 lime wedge to garnish10ml 2:1 sugar syrup1 drop orange flower water (or rose water; optional) Put the liquids in a shaker with a decent fistful of ice, and shake hard. Pour the whole lot, including the ice, into a rocks glass (salt the rim first, if you like), garnish with the lime wedge and serve. • Max Venning, Shop Cuvée, London N5
