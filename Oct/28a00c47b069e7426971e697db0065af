Stellar Group, the London-based sports agency that represents more than 800 athletes, including Gareth Bale, and whose contracts are worth close to $3bn (£2.32bn), has been taken over by the US entertainment agency giant ICM partners. The deal, which sees the creation of ICM Stellar Sports, reflects US confidence in English and European football in particular. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, Premier League clubs have spent £1.45bn in permanent transfer fees this summer, according to the Guardian’s interactive. When the major leagues in Spain, Germany, Italy and France are factored in, the figure rises to £2.99bn. Stellar Group, which was founded in 1992 by Jonathan Barnett and David Manasseh, is best known for its work and influence in football; the agency has seven members of the current England squad – Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope, Dean Henderson, Ben Chilwell, Mason Mount, Jack Grealish and James Ward-Prowse. But it has made inroads into many other sports, including American football in the NFL. ICM Partners represent a host of A-list talent, including Samuel L Jackson, Chris Rock and Beyoncé, and Barnett says the tie-up will enable his existing Stellar Group clients to further their reach and crossover potential and to broaden their brands. “Athletes are brands with global appeal across numerous off-the-field revenue streams, which ICM will help us cultivate and exploit,” Barnett said. Barnett and Manasseh will run the day-to-day operations of the sports agency while all Stellar Group’s 130-plus employees will join ICM Stellar Sports and continue to operate the agency as before. The deal follows the take over of Base Soccer by Creative Artists Agency – the US entertainment and sports company – in July of last year. Established by Leon Angel in 1997, Base have become one of the leading agencies in football.
