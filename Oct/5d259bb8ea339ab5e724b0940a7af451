Skelmersdale United, the lowest-ranked team left in this season’s FA Cup, will travel to Football League new boys Harrogate Town in the first round next month. The North West Counties League Premier Division side won 4-1 at Stafford Rangers to reach this stage of the competition for the first time since 1971. Former winners Ipswich and Portsmouth will clash at Portman Road in the highest-profile of the 40 first round ties. Ipswich won the competition under Bobby Robson in 1978, while Pompey were victorious in 1939 and 2008. National League North side Chorley face a journey of just eight miles to take on Wigan, who shocked Manchester City to win the 2013 final. Two more former winners face long trips to face sides from the National League South. Blackpool, winners of the famous Matthews Final in 1953, travel to Eastbourne Borough, while 1911 winners Bradford go to Tonbridge Angels. The matches are scheduled to take place from 7-9 November, and current coronavirus regulations mean all the games will be played behind closed doors.
