It has been said that size shouldn’t matter, but that doesn’t run true in the case of this year’s most coveted Halloween decoration: a 12ft skeleton from Home Depot with flashing blue eyes. The $300 skeleton is so popular that it has sold out in every Home Depot across the country, with customers manically refreshing the website and driving long distances to get their hands on one. A hang-out-at-the-house kind of day. pic.twitter.com/iNuR1buESr But what’s so good about this gigantic decoration? Sure, it’s got some big skeleton energy – but can bigger really mean that much better? Doesn’t a massive skeleton with flashing blue eyes sound a little bit, well, extra? Perhaps that’s the point. What could be more of a soothing presence in these frightening times than having a skeleton outside your house twice the size of Donald Trump? Behold the sight of it: towering over homes, strapped to car roofs and overshadowing the average human. It’s even bigger than Peppa Pig.

But just look at it dressed as the coronavirus. Have you ever seen anything scarier? And it doesn’t hurt that it can be spotted easily from a distance, too – a social distance-friendly Halloween decoration! Someone did a 2020 Halloween theme 😩😂 🗣CORONAVIRUS 🦠 pic.twitter.com/FuOJtI5EgF It’s no wonder that people who have been unable to buy the skeleton for themselves have been searching for it out in the wild and papping it. As comedian Karen Kilgariff explains in her new podcast in a segment dedicated to explaining how she felt upon first seeing it: “You could liken it to a religious experience, you could liken it to love at first sight, but I was overcome with a sense of security and that someone was gonna defend me from all the terrible things in this world.” Ah, well, now it makes sense.
