When it comes to bread, it’s feast or famine at my house. We’ve either run out – just when I’m most craving buttered toast – or I make too much, forget about it, and find a stale boulder the next time I look in the bread bin. I hate food waste, but the options for stale bread are rather limited. So I’m forever indebted to the reader who inspired this week’s recipe. They suggested using breadcrumbs in a cake and the result is both thrifty and delicious. A blender with the blade attachment is the easiest way to turn stale bread into crumbs. If you don’t have one, a rolling pin, canvas bag and the mental image of a boss you don’t like also works well. Prep 10 minSoak 1 hrCook 45 minServes 8 For the cake100g stale bread, crushed into crumbs175g unsalted butter, softened140g soft brown sugar2 large eggs75g ground almonds25g plain flour1½ tsp baking powderFor the plum topping4 plums100ml red wine75g caster sugar Grease and line a 20cm round cake tin. Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/375F/gas 5. Quarter and stone the plums, then cut each quarter in half again to make eight crescents per plum. Put the plum segments into a pan with the wine and sugar, and simmer gently for six minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the plum segments to soak for one hour. To make the breadcrumbs, blitz the stale bread in a blender (or put it in a canvas bag and bash with a rolling pin). Cream the butter and sugar until pale and airy, then stir through the eggs, followed by the breadcrumbs, almonds, flour and baking powder. Pour the batter into the cake tin, even it out with the back of a spoon, then arrange the poached plum slices over the top. Bake for 20 minutes. While the cake bakes, bring the plum syrup to a boil and cook for a few minutes, until thickened. Brush this over the warm cake once it has finished baking.
