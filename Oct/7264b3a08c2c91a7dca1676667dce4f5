Former ITV journalist Allegra Stratton is expected to be announced as the face of Downing Street’s new daily televised press briefings. Stratton, who is currently an adviser to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will host daily briefings for political journalists. The role will make her a high-profile spokeswoman for Boris Johnson. There are currently two daily lobby briefings for political journalists, which are on the record, but take place behind closed doors. One of these will be replaced by the new daily televised briefing, in a significant shift. The briefings are currently taken by Johnson’s official spokesman, James Slack, the former Daily Mail political editor who did the same job for Theresa May. He is expected to be promoted to a more strategic role. Stratton’s post is part of a shake-up masterminded by Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain, who is increasingly centralising government communications in Downing Street, and intends to significantly reduce the number of civil servants dealing with the press. Cain is having a large room in 9 Downing Street fitted out as a new broadcast studio for the briefings. Stratton was formerly a Guardian journalist, before going on to work at BBC Newsnight before becoming national editor of ITV news Downing Street sources have not yet made any announcement, with one No 10 source insisting the appointment remained “unconfirmed”.
