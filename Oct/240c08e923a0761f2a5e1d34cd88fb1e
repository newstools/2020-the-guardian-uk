Re Nesrine Malik’s piece (‘Patriotism’ is the last refuge of a scandalous government, 19 October), I’ve had a not unrelated experience with my local Tory MP. After some correspondence in which I asked why the government was resuming arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite an appeal court ruling, his final words to me were: “If you want to support al-Qaida and IS, be my guest.” Maggie Winters Benson, Oxfordshire • If the government believes those furloughed can exist on a (further reduced) percentage of previous income (Rishi Sunak to unveil fourth Covid support package for ailing firms, 21 October), it could set an example by reducing parliamentary salaries by the same percentage. After all, we are all in the same boat – aren’t we? Susan Hipperson Haywards Heath, West Sussex • The letter (21 October) on Reading FC’s nickname came too late. When asked for this in the pub quiz we wrote “the Biscuitmen”. The young quizmaster disallowed it in favour of “the Royals” and we lost by one point. We’re used to disappointment in Bury, with the demise of the town’s beloved club, “the Shakers”. Bob Hargreaves Summerseat, Bury, Greater Manchester • I qualified as a teacher in 1957 and my first appointment was to a north London school. My headmistress told me I’d have discipline problems if I didn’t lose my northern accent. I didn’t – and I didn’t (Letters, 21 October)! Christine Clow Redbourn, St Albans • Michael Gove is not 100% bad (Sketch, 19 October). Remember he once told the truth in public – that Boris Johnson is unfit to be PM.
