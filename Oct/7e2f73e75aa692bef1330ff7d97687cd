West Ham’s Felipe Anderson has joined Porto on a season-long loan. Anderson joined West Ham for £36m from Lazio in 2018 and he has scored 12 times in 73 appearances for the club. However, the midfielder has yet to start a Premier League game this season although he did start in the 3-0 Carabao Cup victory over Charlton. “We can confirm that Felipe Anderson has joined Portuguese side FC Porto on a season-long loan. The club wishes Felipe all the best for his loan spell,” read a West Ham statement. Although the transfer window closed for English clubs signing players from abroad, the window in Portugal is open until 25 October. Porto have taken full advantage by also signing the Liverpool midfielder Marko Grujic and the Chelsea defender Malang Sarr on season-long loans.
