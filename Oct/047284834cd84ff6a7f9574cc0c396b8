Greater Manchester is facing “a winter of real hardship” including business closures, job losses and homelessness after the government dramatically walked out of talks over the implementation of England’s strictest coronavirus regulations, Andy Burnham has said. Addressing the media in central Manchester, Greater Manchester’s mayor condemned the government’s “game of poker” approach to the negotiations as tier 3 measures looked set to be imposed on the region of 2.8 million people. Burnham said Greater Manchester’s 10 council leaders had asked for £65m from Boris Johnson’s government, which he said was the “the bare minimum to prevent a winter of real hardship here that is what we believe we needed to prevent poverty, to prevent hardship to prevent homelessness”. He said Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, walked away from the talks at 2pm after refusing to increase the government’s offer of £60m. Burnham said it had turned into a “game of poker with people’s lives” and the government’s actions amounted to a “deliberate act of levelling down”. To cheers in central Manchester, the mayor said he was still willing to do a deal with the government but he added: “It cannot be on the terms that the government offered today because on those things I could not meet the commitments I made to people on the lowest incomes, to people who are self employed, to the freelancers in this city, who need our support, I could not do it on those terms. “How can we carry the public with us through this pandemic if we are forcing them to lose their income, their place of work, without supporting them through that? How is that going to help people … to fight this virus? “Finally I don’t believe we can proceed as a country on this basis through the pandemic, by grinding communities down, through punishing financial negotiations. We are asking a lot of the public at this difficult time. And we need to carry them with us, not crush their spirit. We need national unity.”
