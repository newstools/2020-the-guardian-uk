England’s three-match Cadbury Netball Series against New Zealand began with a 58-45 defeat in Hamilton on Wednesday. The game was England’s first international since January and the world champions proved too good for the visiting side, just as they had been in last year’s World Cup semi-finals. The domestic league in New Zealand having resumed proved an advantage for the Silver Ferns, who looked much the sharper in the opening exchanges and were eight goals up inside the first 10 minutes. Kadeen Corbin’s score helped close the gap and made it 15-10 at the end of the first quarter but New Zealand had pulled away again by half-time, leading 32-24. And Jess Thirlby’s side struggled to make an impact in the second half, trailing 46-35 by the three-quarter mark and New Zealand had extended their lead again by the final whistle. The series continues with the second match on Friday and the third on Sunday, both starting at 6am GMT.
