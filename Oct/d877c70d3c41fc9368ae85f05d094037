This is what I wear to garden in: a T-shirt from the London Greenpeace “What’s Wrong with McDonald’s” campaign, acquired in about 1995; jeans from a charity shop and customised with cyanotype splashes; fleece from a Keswick outdoor shop in about 1993; old shoes – just everyday ones that are too worn out for other wear.

But “a government masquerading as a piece of self-destructive performance art” (The politics sketch, 15 October)? Isn’t it the other way around?Marcia HeinemannLondon
