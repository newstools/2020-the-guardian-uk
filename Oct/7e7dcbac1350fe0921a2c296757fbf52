Hospitality businesses in the north of England have said they will struggle to survive on the new support package unveiled by the chancellor if they are forced into weeks of local lockdowns. Carol Ross, the landlady of the Roscoe Head pub in Liverpool, said the new jobs support package- which includes the government paying 67% of employee salaries if businesses are forced to shut down and a further £3,000 a month in cash grants towards other costs – was not enough. “I’m angry about it. It’s cheaper for us just to shut up if we can’t cover our fixed costs. It is nowhere near enough. They are just helping big business not small businesses,” said Ross. The scheme, announced on Friday and designed to help pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, bowling alleys and other businesses if they are forced to close their doors over the winter, will take effect in November. The existing furlough scheme, which covered up to 80% of pay, ends on 31 October.

Businesses will not be asked to contribute towards staff pay, as they have had to do for the past two months of the furlough, but they will still have to pay national insurance and pension contributions for employees unable to work. Ross said the expected government plan, to follow Scotland and target hospitality businesses with a lockdown across Greater Manchester, parts of Yorkshire, Lancashire and possibly Liverpool and Cumbria, was unfair given the stringent measures many had put in place to limit infection. “Nobody is getting anything from here. Our business is already a third down and we have track and trace and there is space in the pubs. They are just using us as scapegoats.” Adam Reid, the chef patron of The French restaurant inside Manchester’s Midland hotel, agreed that the support package was unlikely to be enough to keep businesses going which had already been hit by months of closures and were now running short of cash. The French only reopened its doors on 1 October and Reid said his future would be linked to whether the Midland was allowed to continue welcoming guests. While the furlough cash might support his staff, Reid’s own pay would not be covered. “I can see a lot of businesses who will look at this and say there isn’t any point in going on,” he said. “The biggest issue is the uncertainty. We could all feel the effect on Monday [when the new lockdowns were first suggested] and it is now Friday afternoon . People are going to have to make snap decisions and they are not going to take risks.” The UK Hospitality trade body, which represents thousands of restaurants, pubs and nightclubs, said the new support scheme was “very welcome” and would help save jobs. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the government needed a more comprehensive package to support businesses which had seen visitor numbers tumble. “The financial support on offer must go further if tragic levels of closures and redundancies are to be averted,” she said. But Alan Gent, the owner of the Petersgate Tap in Stockport, welcomed the furlough and cash grant support which he said would help cover his rent. He said he would switch to delivery if lockdown was imposed again and had already ordered milk cartons – to fill with beer for delivery – in preparation. “My staff are part time with other jobs and all came back last time. We are really hoping that’s going to work again,” he said.
