Actor Jeff Bridges has said he is being treated for lymphoma and his prognosis is good. The 70-year-old channeled his The Dude character from The Big Lebowski in a statement on social media about the diagnosis on Monday evening, tweeting “New S**T has come to light”. As the Dude would say.. New S**T has come to light. I have been diagnosed with Lymphoma. Although it is a serious disease, I feel fortunate that I have a great team of doctors and the prognosis is good. I’m starting treatment and will keep you posted on my recovery. He said he understands the disease is serious. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in the lymphatic system, the body’s disease-fighting network that includes the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus gland and bone marrow. The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Bridges expressed gratitude to his family, friends and medical team and promised to keep fans posted on his recovery. In a second tweet he reminded Americans to “go vote”. Bridges is a seven-time Oscar nominee known for his roles in Starman, True Grit, The Last Picture Show and many other films. He won an Academy Award in 2010 for Crazy Heart and was most recently nominated for playing a grizzled lawman in Hell or High Water. Bridges is son of actors Lloyd and Dorothy Bridges, who both died in 1998. The news of his illness was greeted with dismay by his fans. Hey 2020, leave Jeff Bridges out of this!
