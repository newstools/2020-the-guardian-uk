José Mourinho believes that Son Heung-min is ready to commit the remainder of his peak years to Tottenham. The 28-year-old forward, who has scored nine goals in his past six appearances, is under contract until June 2023 and, as such, there is no immediate urgency to tie him down for longer. But Spurs always like to stay in control of key players’ situations and, in Mourinho’s words, it is “normal that the club tries to go from three [more years] to four or five or six” with Son. “Son has three years of contract so it’s not like we are in an extreme situation of everybody being too worried,” Mourinho said. “I think it’s more a question of Son loves it here and I believe that he would like to commit his future to the club for more time. “It is the club, and everybody in the club, being totally in love for this player and for this boy and trying also to make him feel part of the furniture. It’s a very calm situation. But I wish, he deserves and the club knows that. I believe that sooner or later they will, without any pressure, arrive into a decision.” Son’s numbers so far this season have been eye-catching – he also has four assists – and his off-field commercial pull is huge. No Spurs player sells more shirts, not even Harry Kane. He has come to tick many of the boxes to be considered as a superstar and Mourinho believes that Son is already at the very highest level. “He cannot do more than what he does,” Mourinho said. “Season after season after season, Sonny is showing how good he is. Of course, the better the team is, the easier it is for the players to emerge. But Sonny – everybody knows what he does. “What does he need to do now to go to a next step? Nothing. It is up to the media to do that. He’s also such an incredible kid, he is at that level and it is up to you [in the media] to tell how good he is.”
