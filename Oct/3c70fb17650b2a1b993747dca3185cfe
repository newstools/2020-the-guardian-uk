Andy Robertson has labelled Liverpool’s 7-2 thrashing at Aston Villa as “embarrassing” and “not acceptable”. It was the first time Liverpool had conceded seven since 1963 and Robertson told Liverpool’s website: “At times we couldn’t believe it, to be honest. We weren’t good enough. We never won our second balls, we never won our challenges, we never scored from the chances we did create. “All credit goes to Aston Villa, unfortunately. They were better than us. Every competition on the pitch they won and when that happens you’re never going to win a game of football. That result as a Liverpool player is embarrassing.” The left-back said Liverpool “made far too many mistakes that ended up in goals” and added: “We were 4-1 down in the first half and this Liverpool side believes that we could have come back – of course we did. “But the fact we then go out and concede as many goals in the second half as well, that scoreline becomes embarrassing when you play for this club, it’s not acceptable and that’s something we all have to deal with. “We need to go away for two weeks now [for the international break] and then we’ve got a Merseyside derby [at Everton on 17 October]. Look, the lads will be ready for that. It’s up to us to be as fit and fresh as possible with all the international games, but we’ll stick together and make sure this performance hopefully never happens again.” Ollie Watkins scored a hat-trick, which took his record to five goals in six games since his club-record switch to Villa from Brentford last month. When asked whether it was the best night of his career, the 24-year-old forward told VillaTV: “Yeah, definitely. I’ve scored hat-tricks before but it was against Newport away on a boggy pitch with about 2,000 people there. “It’s a shame there’s no fans here but to score against a team like Liverpool is unbelievable.”
