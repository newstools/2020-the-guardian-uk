As a long-time admirer of the osprey, I appreciated your detailed and highly informative caption to the beautiful picture of an osprey catching a trout (Fish supper, 29 September). It was unfortunate, however, that you referred to the location as a “lake” near Aviemore, rather than a loch, when every schoolchild knows there is only one lake in Scotland (Lake of Menteith, near Aberfoyle), well to the south of the Cairngorms. Phil Murray Linlithgow, West Lothian • Jonathan Jones (Review, 29 September) hails the painter Artemesia Gentileschi as “a forgotten genius”. Forgotten by whom? He must mean by male curators, scholars, artists, art historians, and journalists, as their female and feminist equivalents have been championing Gentileschi’s work since the 1970s. Michele Roberts London • “The vocal Brexit backer [Crispin Odey] is worth about £800m” (Report, 28 September). I think you mean “has about £800m”. Cliff Bowman Olney, Buckinghamshire • I am 92 and wife Betty is 90. Your report mentions the words “streaming” and “Netflix” (‘I want to break cinema’: is Dick Johnson Is Dead the most radical film of 2020?, 29 September). Can old fogies like us have a glossary of those and other such modern technical terms? Chris Birch Kettering, Northamptonshire • Simon Hattenstone on Michael Rosen: “the bags under his eyes are more scrotal than ever” (Michael Rosen on his Covid-19 coma: ‘It felt like a pre-death, a nothingness’, 30 September). What an unkind description. Surely the poor man’s been through enough this year, and is rightly entitled to some excess ocular sag. Stephen McKenna London
