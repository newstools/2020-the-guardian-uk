Adelaide’s Brad Crouch and Tyson Stengle have been suspended by the AFL for two and four games respectively for being caught with illicit drugs. The AFL confirmed on Saturday the pair had been found guilty of “conduct unbecoming”, following an investigation into the September incident. The Crows players will also have a so-called first strike against them under the AFL’s drugs policy and will have to attend a drug-and-alcohol education course prior to next season. Police caught Crouch and Stengle with an illicit drug, understood to be cocaine, in Adelaide’s central business district at 5.15am on 28 September. Police didn’t charge the duo, instead referring them to counselling under a drug diversion program. In April, the Crows suspended Stengle for four games and fined him $2,500 after he was charged with drink-driving and driving an unregistered car. The 21-year-old is due to answer the charges in Adelaide magistrates court later this month. The AFL said it took that “relatively recent” incident into account when determining the length of Stengle’s suspension. In August, Stengle signed a contract extension with the Crows until the end of the 2022 season. Crouch, the Crows’ 2019 club champion, fell off-contract at the end of Adelaide’s season and became a restricted free agent. Rival clubs including Geelong, Richmond and Port Adelaide are understood to be pitching offers to the 26-year-old midfielder. Crouch and Stengle made separate apologies on social media on 1 October, with Crouch admitting he made “a big mistake”. “I hope and trust that it does not define me. This is not who I am,” Crouch posted on Instagram. Stengle said he had let down his family, friends, the Crows and the AFL community. “There is no excuse for my behaviour,” he posted on Instagram.
