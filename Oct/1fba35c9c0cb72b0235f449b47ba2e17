What had been a routine, if dull, win for the Los Angeles Rams against the New York Giants was shaken up when Jalen Ramsey and Golden Tate brawled after the game. Ramsey, a star cornerback for the Rams, and Giants receiver Tate aimed blows at each other before brawling on the ground while teammates attempted to separate the two. Earlier in the game, Ramsey had delivered a big hit on Tate and drove him into the turf after he caught a pass. 😤 @jalenramsey 😤📺: #NYGvsLAR on FOX📱: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app: https://t.co/024EzSafTB pic.twitter.com/JoDAS9EKD1 The bad blood between the two started before Sunday though. Ramsey has two children with Tate’s sister, Breanna. According to the New York Post, Ramsey ended the relationship while Breanna Tate was pregnant last year and reportedly began dating a Las Vegas dancer. “I’m not happy at all with the disrespect that he’s shown towards my sister, and the things he’s done in the past, but I don’t really want to go too much into it,” Tate said of the situation prior to Sunday’s game. Ramsey had also talked about the tension on social media in the past. He wrote: “We live in a society where ignorant people feel that they are owed an explanation of what goes on in our day-to-day lives … and why we make the decisions we make … we don’t have to answer to anyone but the man above. Shit is beyond overrated.” Ramsey has a reputation as a trash-talker. In the 2017, Ramsey’s it was enough to provoke the normally mild-mannered Cincinnati Bengals receiver AJ Green into a fight. “I told him almost every play that he was weak, that he was soft,” Ramsey said at the time. “Those are straight facts. He just can’t handle the truth. It’s facts. I told him his time was almost up. I told him that it was easy, which it was. He had one catch for six yards. I was just out there spitting facts to him. He got mad.” In 2018, Ramsey called into question quarterback Josh Allen’s ability after he was drafted by the Buffalo Bills. “I think Allen is trash,” Ramsey told GQ in a lengthy interview. “I don’t care what nobody say. He’s trash. And it’s gonna show too. That’s a stupid draft pick to me. We play them this year, and I’m excited as hell. I hope he’s their starting quarterback ... [During his college career] he never beat a big school. If you look at his games against big schools, it was always hella interceptions, hella turnovers. It’s like: Yo, if you’re this good, why couldn’t you do better?” Earlier this season, Ramsey conceded he now thinks Allen is “talented”.
