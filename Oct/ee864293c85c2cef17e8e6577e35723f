Liverpool’s mayor has condemned large crowds of revellers who gathered in the city centre hours before lockdown measures kicked in and threw drinks at police cars, saying their actions “shame our city”. Videos on social media showed huge crowds of people dancing and singing in Concert Square, a popular nightlife spot, at 10pm after pubs and bars closed for the last time before stricter lockdown measures came into force at midnight. The Liverpool city region is the only part of the country to move into the highest tier 3 lockdown restrictions on Wednesday, meaning pubs and bars which do not serve meals have been forced to close, and social mixing is banned indoors and in private gardens. Gyms, betting shops and casinos have also been shut, while restaurants are allowed to stay open. Mayor Joe Anderson criticised the partygoers, saying: “These pictures shame our city, attacking our brave police officers is unacceptable. Our health service is creaking, 300 in hospital and 30 people dead in week, ignoring these facts is why we are in tier 3 measures.” These pictures Shame our City, attacking our brave Police Officers is unacceptable.Our Health Service is creaking,300 in Hospital&30 people dead in week 😱ignoring these facts is why we are in Tier 3 measures. https://t.co/WIW12AuAhr Liverpool councillor Nick Small also criticised the crowds, tweeting: “Idiots putting themselves, their friends, families and everyone else at risk, destroying jobs and our hospitality sector while they do it.” Videos posted on social media show crowds flouting social distancing rules, many not wearing masks, as they dance, chant and sing songs in the middle of the square. Another video, taken from a nearby flat, shows the crowds booing at a police car as it moves into the square, before throwing drinks at the vehicle and banging on the windows. Merseyside police said officers were deployed to the area immediately and a large crowd was dispersed quickly and safely. Chief Supt Peter Costello said: “While we understand how the new rules which are due to be implemented on Wednesday are frustrating for some we would continue to advise everyone to abide by them – including keeping social distancing – for the safety of everyone.” Liverpool has the third-highest number of Covid-19 hospital admissions in Europe, and more than 95% of the city’s intensive care beds are occupied. About half of the intensive care beds across the city’s University hospitals NHS foundation trust have been taken by patients being treated for Covid-19.
