From oast houses in Kent to thatched longhouses in Wales, “vernacular architecture” styles – architecture characterised by the use of local materials and knowledge – is a niche but fascinating part of the British landscape. If you’ve stayed in, visited or simply seen a building that’s unique to a particular area, please tell us about it. It may be a Highland bothy converted from a shieling; Cotswolds cottages made from distinctive local stone; a weaver’s cottage in Yorkshire; or an old Cumbrian barn. We want to know all about these rare, local architectural gems. If possible, please send a good quality photo of the building (that you have the copyright for), but remember that it is your words that will be judged for the competition. The building may be somewhere you’ve become aware of only because lockdown meant exploring more locally, or perhaps it’s a place you’ve discovered on a country walk. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and maybe the paper too. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
