Ajax set an Eredivisie record when they scored 13 goals past 10-man VVV-Venlo to move to the top of the league on Saturday, with seven different players on the score sheet. The previous record for an Eredivisie game was also held by Ajax after they beat Vitesse 12-1 in 1972. Led by the 19-year-old Lassina Traoré, who scored five times and assisted three more, Ajax were already 4-0 up when Venlo were reduced to 10 men after skipper Christian Kum was sent off on VAR review for a high boot. What followed was an eight-goal burst in 24 second-half minutes as Ajax’s players controlled possession and lined up to take shots on goal, with veteran 37-year-old forward Klaas Jan Huntelaar scoring twice in two minutes at Venlo’s De Koel stadium. The visitors finished the match with an eye-watering 23 shots on target and could have scored more had Venlo goalkeeper Delano van Crooij not made 10 saves.
