An Under-19 friendly between England and Scotland was abandoned after Scotland’s head coach Billy Stark received news of a positive Covid-19 test during the match. Negative tests were returned by players and staff from both teams ahead of the game at the Football Association’s St George’s Park training complex. But, with the sides scheduled to meet again on Sunday, a second round of testing was required and returned a positive case for Stark, prompting the fixture to be halted. England led 3-1 at the time. “Despite testing negative during Sunday’s test, the head coach, Billy Stark, returned a positive test for Covid-19 this afternoon,” a statement from the Scottish Football Association read. “The result of the second test was immediately relayed to the under-19 team manager and the game was abandoned immediately, in line with established Covid-19 protocol.” Stark will travel home in isolation and self-isolate for 10 days, while Scotland’s players and the rest of the backroom team will undertake precautionary self-isolation for 14 days. Sunday’s match between the sides has been postponed, in addition to an Under-17 fixture scheduled to be held at St George’s Park on Saturday.
