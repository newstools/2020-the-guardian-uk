Visiting Karnataka in India, I ate a lot of this mung bean salad. This was the first time I’d had a salad of raw, soaked dal and I fell in love with the texture. It is so easy to prepare and the salad stays fresh for a few days so you can make a big batch. One portion I had came as part of a thali and included small cubes of fresh, sweet mango. I was told this wasn’t traditional, but the fruit complemented the coconut, and its sweetness balanced out the lime, so I’ve included it in my version. You can use it as a base salad and add whatever else you like. 100g split yellow mung beans100g cucumber1 mango100g carrot40g fresh coconut2g mint leaves7g coriander stalks and leaves20ml vegetable oil1 tsp mustard seeds¼ tsp asafoetidaJuice of 1 lime1 tsp salt Soak the mung beans in cold water for one hour. While they’re soaking, chop the cucumber and mango into small cubes (0.5cm) and add to a mixing bowl. Finely grate the carrot and coconut, shred the mint and coriander, and add to the mixture. Drain the mung beans in a sieve and rinse under cold water. Knock the sieve to make sure all the water drains away and then add the beans to the bowl. When ready to eat, add the lime juice and salt, and mix through. In a small frying pan heat the oil then add the mustard seeds. Once they pop remove from the heat and stir through the asafoetida. Pour this on to the salad and mix through.
