Sabri Lamouchi has been sacked as manager by Nottingham Forest and immediately replaced by Chris Hughton. Lamouchi’s departure has seemed inevitable ever since Forest missed out on the Championship play-offs on the final day of last season and became a near certainly following a start to this campaign that has seen the team lose all their five games, four of which were in the Championship. Forest sit in the relegation zone. “Nottingham Forest can confirm that the contract of head coach Sabri Lamouchi has been terminated with immediate effect,” read a brief club statement. It was followed half an hour later by a much longer statement confirming Hughton’s arrival. “Nottingham Forest are delighted to announce the appointment of Chris Hughton as the club’s new manager. Hughton joins the club with a wealth of managerial experience, leading both Newcastle United and Brighton to promotion from the Championship and going on to establish both teams in the Premier League,” it read. “The former Republic of Ireland international also boasted an impressive playing career, winning two FA Cups and the Uefa Cup during his time at Tottenham Hostpur. “Hughton has also managed Norwich City in the Premier League, leading them to an 11th-placed finish in 2012-13, and has managed close to 450 first-team games with a win percentage of over 40%.” Lamouchi, a former France international, was appointed by Forest in June 2019 as a replacement for Martin O’Neill and was let go just four months after signing a new two-year contract. Hughton is back in work having been dismissed by Brighton in May 2019, despite keeping the club in the Premier League for two seasons. The 61-year-old is Forest’s 11th manager in a little over five years.
