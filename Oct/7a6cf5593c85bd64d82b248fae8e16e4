My chocolate consumption reached new heights over lockdown, and I know I was not alone. Those little chocolate pots in the shops became a rather too frequent pleasure, even though they’re often expensive, a bit sweet and, annoyingly, contain palm oil, which I am trying to avoid. A homemade version is very simple, however: something suitably naughty, but comforting, and with a little Mexican twist. But be warned: they are totally irresistible. The combination of unaged tequila, dark chocolate and cream is unbelievably delicious, making this a true desert island treat. Prep 20 minCook 1 hrChill 3 hrMakes 6-8 6 egg yolks3 tbsp caster sugar1 pinch salt150g 70% cocoa dark chocolate250ml double cream250ml whole milk½ tsp ground cinnamon1 tbsp 100% agave tequila, or rum (optional) Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas 3. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks, sugar and a pinch of salt with an electric mixer or whisk for two to three minutes, until pale. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a microwave or over a pan of just-simmering water. Put the cream and milk in a saucepan, bring to simmering point, then take off the heat and slowly whisk into the melted chocolate. Whisk this in turn into the beaten eggs, then whisk in the cinnamon and tequila, if using, and pour into a large jug. Divide the mixture between six to eight ramekins, cover each one with foil and place in a deep roasting pan. Bring a kettle to a boil, then pour enough hot water into the tray to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for an hour, then lift out the ramekins from their hot bath, remove their foil lids and leave to cool. Once cool, refrigerate for three hours until thoroughly chilled. Serve with good pouring cream – you can find some delicious ones online and in farm shops – and little biscuits, if you like. Make financiers with the leftover egg whites, and top with the very last of the season’s blackberries.
