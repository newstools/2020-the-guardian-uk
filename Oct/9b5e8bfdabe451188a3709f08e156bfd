Porn star Ron Jeremy was charged on Wednesday with an additional seven counts of rape and sexual assault, bringing to 23 the number of his alleged victims, the Los Angeles district attorney’s office said. Jeremy, 67, one of the biggest names in the adult film industry, was initially charged in June with raping three women and sexually assaulting a fourth, but more women have come forward to police since then. The new charges, which include three counts of rape, span a 17-year period. His alleged victims range from 15 to 54 years old, the district attorney’s office said in a statement. The 17-year-old was raped at a Woodland Hills home in 2008, prosecutors contend. The other alleged victims include a 19-year-old woman who was raped during a photo shoot in the San Fernando valley; a 26-year-old woman who was raped at a party in a nightclub; a 38-year-old who was sexually assaulted at a West Hollywood bar where Jeremy was a regular; a woman who was sexually assaulted at Jeremy’s home and a woman who was assaulted at a strip club. Jeremy on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to the new charges in a brief court appearance where a 14 December preliminary hearing date was set. Jeremy now faces a total of 11 counts of rape, eight of sexual battery and 16 other sexual offenses. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of more than 330 years to life in state prison. Nicknamed “the Hedgehog”, Jeremy has been among the best-known and most prolific performers in the adult film industry since the 1970s, and has appeared in more than 2,000 adult films. Jeremy, whose legal name is Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, was investigated and charged by a district attorney’s task force formed to take on sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry as the #MeToo era gained momentum in late 2017. He has been held in jail on $6.6m bail since June.
