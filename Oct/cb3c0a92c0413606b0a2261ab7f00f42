Asda has been sold to two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital in a deal that values the supermarket chain at £6.8bn. Asda, which is owned by the US retail giant Walmart, announced the sale to Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who made their fortunes running the EG Group petrol station group, and TDR. Under the new ownership structure, the Issa brothers and TDR Capital are acquiring a majority ownership stake in Britain’s third largest supermarket chain. Walmart will retain a stake in the business, with an ongoing commercial relationship and a seat on the board. In a joint statement, Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they were “very proud to be investing in Asda, an iconic British business that we have admired for many years”. Asda said it would continue to be based in Leeds and that Roger Burnley would remain as chief executive. The consortium has promised to invest £1bn in Asda over the next three years and also promised to “maintain competitive pay levels” for staff. Regulators blocked Walmart’s earlier attempt to quit the UK by ruling against a proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury’s, and the new deal will need regulatory approval. Judith McKenna, the chief executive officer of Walmart International, said the deal created the “right ownership structure” for Asda. “I’m delighted that Walmart will retain a significant financial stake, a board seat and will continue as a strategic partner.”
