Serie A leaders Milan dropped their first points of the season, despite a Zlatan Ibrahimovic double, when a defiant Roma came from behind three times to draw 3-3 in an enthralling game at San Siro on Monday. Ibrahimovic, 39, gave Milan the lead in the second minute before Edin Dzeko headed Roma level 12 minutes later. Alexis Saelemaekers put Milan back in front two minutes after the break and Roma hit back again in the 71st minute with a controversial penalty converted by Jordan Veretout. Milan regained the lead with a penalty converted by Ibrahimovic, his sixth league goal of the season, but Marash Kumbulla equalised again for Roma with six minutes left. Milan have 13 points from five games, two ahead of Napoli and Sassuolo, while Roma have eight. In the Bundesliga, Bayer Leverkusen rose to fourth with a 3-1 win over Augsburg, with Lucas Alario scoring twice before Moussa Diaby sealed the points deep into stoppage time. In La Liga, strugglers Levante and Celta Vigo played out a 1-1 draw, with Roger Martí’s penalty cancelled out by defender Sergio Carreira, who scored his first senior goal on 52 minutes.
