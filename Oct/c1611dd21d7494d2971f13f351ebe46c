Arsenal have made a dramatic late move to meet the release clause of Atlético Madrid’s Thomas Partey, who could now join in a £45m deal before the close of the transfer window. Partey has been wanted by Arsenal for several years and was, along with Lyon’s Houssem Aouar, Mikel Arteta’s top target. The club have been struggling to secure either player, with funds at a premium, but are understood to have expressed an intention to meet the fee for Partey and if all goes to plan a medical could take place in Madrid on Monday evening. Should the other hurdles be crossed, the Guardian understands personal terms would be a formality. Partey would sign a four-year deal worth around £250,000 a week and seven-figure signing on fee. His release clause is worth £45m and upon meeting that Arsenal would get their man. One of Arsenal’s existing midfielders, Matteo Guendouzi, has signed for Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan. Guendouzi has been out of favour since June and Arteta, exasperated by various issues with the player, has been keen to move him on. Hertha are understood to have paid a loan fee for Guendouzi but there is no obligation to buy.
