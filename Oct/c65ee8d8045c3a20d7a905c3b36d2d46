Ukraine have included the 45-year-old retired goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy in the squad for their friendly against France on Wednesday after three other keepers tested positive for Covid-19. Shovkovskiy, who retired in 2016 and has made about 90 appearances for Ukraine, is assistant to the head coach, Andriy Shevchenko. The Ukrainian football federation (UAF) said in a statement that Shovkovskiy was in “good physical shape” and would provide emergency backup to Georgiy Bushchan, their only available goalkeeper. The Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov, along with the midfielder Taras Stepanenko, missed the trip to Paris after testing positive for Covid-19. On Tuesday the UAF said the goalkeepers Andriy Lunin and Yuriy Pankiv had also tested positive.
