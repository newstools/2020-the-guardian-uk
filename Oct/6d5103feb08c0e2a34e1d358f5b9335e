A David Hockney painting valued at £27m ($35m) and described as “the most significant landscape by Hockney to ever appear at auction” has gone on show in London. The 1980 piece, Nichols Canyon, depicts a winding road through hills in Los Angeles, and marks the beginning of Hockney’s exploration of panoramic landscapes. The painting is on show at the Phillips auction house in Mayfair until Sunday, before it is moved to be displayed in New York and Hong Kong ahead of its sale. Jeal-Paul Engelen, deputy chairman and co-head of 20th century and contemporary art at Phillips, said: “Nichols Canyon is, without question, the most significant landscape by Hockney to ever appear at auction.” The work’s companion painting, Mulholland Drive: The Road to the Studio, is held in the permanent collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Phillips said, while Nichols Canyon has been in a private collection for nearly four decades. In February, Hockney’s iconic 1966 painting The Splash sold at Sotheby’s London for £23.1m ($29.8m). Earlier this month, the Royal Opera House in London sold Hockney’s portrait of its longtime general administrator Sir David Webster to raise funds to help it survive the coronavirus pandemic. The painting sold for £12.8m ($16.8m). His 1972 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) became the most expensive painting by a living artist sold at auction when it fetched $90.3m (£70.3m) in 2018. Nichols Canyon will be on display in London until 1 November and the auction will take place on 7 December in New York.
