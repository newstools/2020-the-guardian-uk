The classic cocktail of winter racing gets a shaken martini twist. Perfect in October as we look ahead to next month’s Gold Cup at Newbury, affectionately known as the Hennessy. Serves 1 50ml VSOP cognac – we use Hennessy Fine de Cognac25ml cold-pressed ginger shot – homemade or bought in (Pret, Fighter and Press all do good ones) 1 tiny splash ginger wine1 tiny splash Angostura bittersLemon peel, to garnish Put all the liquids in a shaker over ice, shake until very cold, then strain into a martini coupe. Rub the lemon peel all around the rim of the glass, then twist, drop into the drink and serve. • Dom Jacobs, bar director, The Fitzdares Club, London W1
