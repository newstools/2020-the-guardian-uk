Whether culture wars are a sign of the Tories’ weakness is debatable (The Tories’ culture war is a reminder that the right isn’t as fearless as it seems, 9 October), but they are dangerous territory for Labour. Andy Beckett proffers only the hope that attitudes will change over time, but this is by no means assured and, in the meantime, Tory hegemony will be consolidated. Keir Starmer needs to rethink his chosen battleground of family, security and patriotism. These notions are sufficiently all-encompassing that they can be embraced by politicians of any complexion, but any reasonable interpretation risks being drowned in a torrent of rightwing populism. The Covid-19 pandemic should not involve, as Starmer has said, wiping the slate clean. On the contrary, it gives Labour an opportunity to dominate the narrative on the very values that the public agree are the basis for a post-Covid future, based on social solidarity, equality and preservation of the planet. The Tories are on much weaker ground here, having presided over private sector failure, demonstrated the importance of massive state intervention and endorsed the green industrial revolution, even if only rhetorically. These are the battles Labour must win, rather than being sidetracked by phoney wars of the Tories’ choosing.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon
