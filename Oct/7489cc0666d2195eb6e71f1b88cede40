The number of racially or religiously aggravated offences in England and Wales rose in June and July, most likely linked to Black Lives Matters protests and far-right counter-protests, the Home Office has said. The number of offences recorded by police increased year on year by 34% in June to 6,697 and about 17% in July to 6,677, following declines between March and May when the UK was under a coronavirus lockdown. The Home Office said the increases in June and July were probably related to Black Lives Matters protests and far-right counter-demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in the US. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes as he told them “I can’t breathe”. His death sparked a wave of protests across the world, including the UK. The same Home Office bulletin shows the number of hate crimes recorded by police rose by 8% in England and Wales in the year to 2020. There were 105,090 hate crimes recorded by the police in 2019-20, compared with 97,446 in 2018-19. Race hate crimes accounted for about 72% of offences and had risen by 6% since 2018-19, the figures reveal. Religious hate crime fell by 5% to 6,822 offences, down from a peak of 7,203 the previous year, representing the first drop in religious hate crime since 2012-13. Sexual orientation hate crime rose by 19% to 15,835 and transgender identity hate crime by 16% to 2,540, while disability hate crime increased by 9% to 8,469. The Home Office report said: “These percentage increases are smaller than seen in recent years.” More than half of the hate crimes (53%) recorded by police were for public order offences, with more than a third (38%) for violence against a person, while 5% were recorded as criminal damage and arson offences, the report said. The report revealed that it takes more than five times as long for police to deal with a hate crime offence than a non-hate crime offence. Police take on average four days to record an outcome – such as a charge or summons or no further action, for non-hate crime offences, compared with 25 days for hate crime offences.
