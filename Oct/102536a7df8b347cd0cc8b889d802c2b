From adventures in sourdough to WFH lunches, most of us have spent a lot more time in the kitchen this year. We’d love to hear about the best kitchen tip or trick you’ve gleaned from lockdown and beyond, for a future special issue of G2, the Guardian’s daily features section. It could be a revolutionary recipe, a hero ingredient, a batch-cooking favourite that kept you going all week, a delicious store-cupboard standby, or a healthy snacking option for homeschooling kids. You can send in your tip by filling in the form below. Tell us in a few words how it helped you during this year.
