In Bandung, the capital of West Java province, police used tear gas against protesters who hurled rocks and fire crackers and damaged a police car, according to news website Detik.com.

Critics of the omnibus law, which revises more than 70 existing laws to accelerate reform of south-east Asia‚Äôs largest economy, say it is too pro-business with its removal of labour protections and relaxation of environmental rules. Government officials say the law relaxes rigid labour rules and streamlines environmental rules in order to improve the investment climate and create jobs. Indonesian markets cheered the passage of the bill, with the main stock index up as much as 1.31% and the rupiah also gaining. lifting 1.28%, before paring some gains. The government‚Äôs investment board said it would lead to better welfare for workers by facilitating more foreign investment. Citibank, in a research note, said the law simplifies business licensing and addresses restrictive trade and labour policies, but added that immediate foreign investment was unlikely in the currently depressed global economic climate. Trimegah Securities economist, Fakhrul Fulvian, said banks and export-oriented industries should benefit from the law, while consumer and retail sectors may be pressured as workers may increase savings to compensate for changes in labour rules. However, many Indonesians criticised the law on Twitter, with one trending hashtag incorporating an expletive against parliament and another calling lawmakers traitors.
