A man has been shot dead during rival protests by leftwing and rightwing groups in the US city of Denver. Police arrested a suspect who NBC News affiliate, KUSA-TV, said was working as a security guard to protect the station’s crew, according to its website. “It has been the practice of (KUSA) for a number of months to hire private security to accompany staff at protests,” the station said. The shooting took place on Saturday in a courtyard at the Denver Art Museum during a so-called “Patriot Rally” that was met by counter-protests by groups who dubbed their rally a “BLM-Antifa Soup Drive”. Denver police chief of investigations, Joe Montoya, would not confirm if the suspect worked for the station. Neither the victim nor the suspected shooter has been identified by authorities. Montoya said police kept the two groups separated, and there were no other arrests during the competing rallies. A photographer for the Denver Post captured an image of a man spraying a chemical agent at another man with a drawn hand gun.
