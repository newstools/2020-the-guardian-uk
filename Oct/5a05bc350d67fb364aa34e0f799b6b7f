Former Major League Baseball player Charles Haeger, sought in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend in a Phoenix suburb, was found dead on Saturday at the Grand Canyon, police said. Haeger’s body was discovered at about 4pm on a trail along the south rim of the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona, Sgt Ben Hoster, a Scottsdale Police Department spokesman, said in a statement on Saturday night. Police say he took his own life. Police were seeking Haeger, 37, on suspicion of murder and aggravated assault in the fatal shooting of Danielle Breed, 34, on Friday, Hoster said. Breed owned The Tipsy Coyote Bar and Grill in Scottsdale, the Arizona Republic reported. Earlier Saturday, Haeger’s unoccupied vehicle was found near Flagstaff, police said. Flagstaff is 118 miles north of Scottsdale. Haeger, a knuckleball pitcher, was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in 2001, and he pitched 83 innings in the major leagues from 2006 to 2010. His career included stints with the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, Seattle Mariners and Boston Red Sox organizations. Hoster said investigators determined that a male roommate of the victim heard gunshots when he returned to their residence on Friday and that moments later Haeger emerged from the victim’s bedroom with a handgun. “Haeger then pointed the handgun at the roommate. The roommate quickly escaped out of the back of the residence, and he was able to get a neighbor to call 911,” Hoster said in a statement. Responding police found the victim dead in her bedroom, Hoster said. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.
