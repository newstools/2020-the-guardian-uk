The former Cardiff and Aston Villa midfielder Peter Whittingham is in hospital with head injuries. The 35-year-old had what South Wales police have described as “an accidental fall” in a Barry pub 11 days ago. A statement released on Wednesday read: “At around 10pm on 7 March police were called to a licensed premises in Barry. A 35-year-old man from Penarth suffered a head injury as a result of a fall and remains at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. At this stage there is no evidence or suggestion of a criminal act and it appears the injury was caused by an accidental fall. Enquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the incident.” Whittingham, a former England Under-21 international, started his career at Villa before joining Cardiff in 2007. Whittingham moved to Blackburn after a decade at Cardiff and left Ewood Park in August 2018. Whittingham helped Cardiff reach the 2008 FA Cup final, which they lost 1-0 to Portsmouth, and the 2012 League Cup final, where they were beaten on penalties by Liverpool. He was in the side who won the Championship in 2013, taking Cardiff back to the top flight for the first time since relegation from the old Division One in 1962. A Cardiff statement on Wednesday read: “We’d like to thank the football community for their messages in support of Peter and his family. All of our thoughts are with them, as we ask for their privacy to be respected at this time.”
