The tennis commentator and former French Open doubles champion Patrick McEnroe has confirmed he has tested positive for Covid-19. The 53-year-old announced the news in a video posted on his Twitter account. “We’ve been on full quarantine, our entire house now, for well over two weeks,” he said. “I encourage everyone to do the same. Let’s get this thing. Let’s nail this thing. I’m an example of someone who has been able to fight through it. I’m doing absolutely fine. Thoughts and prayers to people who are struggling with this.” Update... pic.twitter.com/5P1diSt98D McEnroe is a familiar presence on ESPN, where he often commentates alongside his older brother, John. While McEnroe’s tennis career did not reach the same heights enjoyed by his brother, he was the world No3 in doubles at his peak and won the men’s doubles at the French Open in 1989. He also reached the semi-finals of the 1991 Australian Open in singles. Following his retirement from playing, he took over from John as USA Davis Cup captain and led his team to the title in 2007.
