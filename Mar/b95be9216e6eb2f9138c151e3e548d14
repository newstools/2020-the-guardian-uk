Long gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain. We’re in the golden age of television – and there’s no better way to enjoy it than with friends and family, gasping at the twists and turns of Inside No9 or the actions of Jessica after she downs another glass of Pinot on Love is Blind. Sadly, one of the victims of the coronavirus pandemic has been the ability to come together to enjoy your favourite show – so we here at Guardian Towers thought it would be fun to revisit one of your favourite TV series of yesteryear and watch along all together, discussing it as we go in the comment thread. The BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and All4 have a wealth of classic dramas, comedy and reality TV to enjoy – from Life on Mars, to A Touch of Frost or Channel 4’s Faking It.
