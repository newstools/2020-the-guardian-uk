Disney’s new streaming service will launch in the UK and Western Europe with hits such as Frozen 2 streamed at slower speeds to reduce congestion on broadband networks as millions are confined to their homes. Disney has pledged to reduce the streaming speed of content offered through Disney+, which launches in the UK and most major European markets on 24 March, by 25% in line with Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and Google’s YouTube which have already agreed deals to reduce pressure on European broadband networks. The French government has gone a step further and asked Disney, which is set to release the hit Star Wars live action spin-off The Mandalorian outside the US, to delay the launch of Disney+. “To our French fans, the Disney+ service is coming, but at the request of the French government, we have agreed to postpone the launch until Tuesday, 7 April 2020,” said Kevin Mayer, Walt Disney Company’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international. Mayer said: “In line with Disney’s longstanding commitment to act responsibly, we are responding to the request of European commissioner for internal market Thierry Breton to work together to ensure the smooth functioning of the broadband infrastructure. “In anticipation of high consumer demand for Disney+, we are proactively instituting measures to lower our overall bandwidth utilisation by at least 25% in all of the markets launching Disney+ on 24 March. “In the coming days, we will be monitoring internet congestion and working closely with internet service providers to further reduce bitrates as necessary to ensure they are not overwhelmed by consumer demand. We look forward to the launch of Disney+ and hope it will provide a much-needed respite for families in these challenging and trying times.” Disney+ will be home to films and shows from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic, as well as Disney, when it launches in the UK on Tuesday.
