Since Colombian reggaeton sensation J Balvin’s global breakthrough with 2017 banger Mi Gente, his stock has risen thanks in part to a slew of well-chosen collaborations that have ridden the wave of streaming culture’s democratisation. From Beyoncé appearing on a Mi Gente remix, to global smashes with the likes of Cardi B (I Like It) and fellow Latin sensation Rosalía (Con Altura), Balvin has expertly curated his superstar status by bringing other people into his world without compromise (he still sings and raps in Spanish). Perhaps keen to reiterate how in control he is, his sixth album, Colores (each song is named after a shade), limits outside guests to just one, with Nigerian Afrobeats star Mr Eazi bringing a swooning softness to the dancefloor-ready Arcoíris. Elsewhere it’s Balvin’s show, be it utilising a Drake-esque croon on the excellent R&B slow jam-esque Rojo, or eerily stalking the drip-feed beat that underpins bass-rattling highlight, Negro. Aware that any language barrier can be overcome by a plethora of hooks and a prevailing atmosphere, Balvin adds a playful embellishment to each of the album’s 10 tracks, be it Amarillo’s kazoo-assisted beat, or the twinkling glacial percussion that tickles closer Blanco. A riot not just of colour, but of ideas too.
