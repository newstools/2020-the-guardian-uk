An errant ear appearing in the bottom right corner of the screen. A blur of fur flashing in the background, followed by a crash. The chance to check out our colleagues’ pets during video conferences can be a voyeuristic joy for workers stuck at home during the novel coronavirus pandemic. It took Mark Polchleb, a brand manager from Melbourne, just one day to realise that experience deserved its own home online. “I just took advantage of the fact that my dogs are at my feet. I thought ‘we all need a bit of happiness in our lives right now’.” “If I stand like this long enough, she’ll assume this is how hard I work every day she’s not here” - @thecuriousmaxx A post shared by  Dogs Working From Home (@dogsworkingfromhome) on Mar 17, 2020 at 4:38pm PDT That bit of happiness became @DogsWorkingFromHome, an Instagram account dedicated to the pets that both enliven and complicate working remotely. “I think we’ve all experienced trying to type on the keyboard with the dog edging its head into your hands,” he says. 9am > 1pm > 3pm - We hear you, Orlando.

Now it has become more of a distraction than his actual dogs. “It’s hard to balance [posting] and actually working, so my husband’s helping out now … so there’s a constant feed of happiness for everyone to enjoy.” Maggie has things down pat and has scored the best seat in the house.

Obviously we’re at a time where we’re encouraging people to stay at home and indoors. We’ve had people submitting dogs at cafes, which is a big ‘no-no’ from me. We want to see those doggos at home with their families where everyone should be staying for now. The “That Zoom Meeting could have been an email” mood.
