The Venice architecture biennale, a two-yearly showcase for the most cutting-edge building around the world, has been postponed due to coronavirus. The event, due to open on 23 May, will now open on 29 August and close on its original closing date, 29 November, cutting short its six-month run to three. A statement from the biennale – which has as its theme the question How Can We Live Together? – said that since the event would have involved architects and institutions from over 60 countries, it could not have taken place given “the recent precautionary measures in the matter of mobility taken by the governments of a growing number of countries around the world, which will have a domino effect on the movement of people and works in coming weeks.” Several nations including the US, Turkey and Australia have banned anyone who has been in China within the past month from entering their territory. Italy, the biennale’s host country, today drew up a draft decree to close theatres and cinemas and ban all public events, as it struggles to contain the outbreak. The postponement calls into question whether other large-scale public events this summer may be able to go ahead unimpeded by the outbreak – including the Euro 2020 football championships, the Tokyo Olympics and even the Venice film festival, which is due to take place in September. Today the London book fair announced that it would be cancelled, while the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, will be postponed until November.
