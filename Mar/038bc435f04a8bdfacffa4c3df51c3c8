Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’ve been working at home for a week now but my back is killing me. There are no office chairs to be had so I need some DIY tips to find seating that works. A friend told me to take the back off my chair and to sit upright – is he right? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
