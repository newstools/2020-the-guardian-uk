Five people including a police officer and a gunman died at a Missouri gas station after the gunman went inside and opened fire, police said on Monday. Three citizens were also killed, Springfield police chief Paul Williams announced. One officer was injured, and another citizen. Williams said police received reports of “multiple shooting calls throughout the city” late on Sunday. As officers were responding, witnesses reported that a vehicle crashed into a Kum & Go gas station and convenience store and the gunman ran inside and began shooting customers and employees, Williams added. The first two officers who arrived were shot. Other officers pulled the injured officers from the store then went inside, finding three citizens dead. The gunman was also dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot, Williams said. Officer Christopher Walsh died at a hospital, Williams said. Walsh was with the Springfield police for three and a half years, was an army veteran and was active in the army reserves. Officer Josiah Overton, whose injuries were not life-threatening, has been with Springfield police for two years, Williams said. “Both officers showed significant bravery and were heroic in their actions,” Williams said. The identifies of the other victims were not immediately released, pending notification of relatives. Police were still working to determine a motive for the shooting, the chief said, adding that it was too early to comment on the impact the shooting had on his department. “We’re still investigating multiple crime scenes and dealing with grieving the loss of one of our own,” he said.
