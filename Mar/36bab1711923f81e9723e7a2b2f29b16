Football star Ronaldinho has been arrested in a hotel in Paraguay’s capital after authorities said he entered the country with falsified documents. The 39-year-old Brazilian and his brother, Roberto Assis, were taken to a police station in Asunción shortly before 10pm local time on Friday, Paraguay’s prosecutors office said in a statement. Ronaldinho’s lawyer Sergio Queiroz confirmed the arrest to the Associated Press and said his legal team in Paraguay had filed an injunction to release the 2002 World Cup winner and his brother. Shortly before the arrests Queiroz told the AP the former Barcelona star was preparing to take a flight back to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives.
