Chris Froome has led the tributes to Nicolas Portal after the sporting director at Team Ineos died on Tuesday aged just 40. Portal, a former cyclist who rode for Team Sky at the end of his career before the Frenchman remained with them after retiring in 2011, was part of the backroom team which has helped Froome to win all four of his Tour de France titles. “My thoughts are with Nico’s wife and children tonight,” Froome tweeted. “He was the kindest, happiest guy I knew and always lived life to the fullest. Rest In Peace Nico.” A statement from Team Ineos confirmed that Portal had “died suddenly” at his home in Andorra. The French sports daily L’Equipe reported that he died of cardiac arrest, with Portal known to have endured a history of heart problems that forced him to miss most of the 2009 season because of cardiac arrhythmia.

He went on to become an important cog in the team which dominated the Tour until changing name to Team Ineos last year.
