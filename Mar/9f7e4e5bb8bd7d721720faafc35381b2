‘A man’s power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face.” It’s a bewitching line from Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, spellbinding in its subtlety of observation and description. Yet I never grasped how mesmerising that sentence could be until I heard it, rather than read it. Waiting for The Mirror and the Light, the final part of Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell trilogy, I decided, as I often do, to reread the earlier volumes. But why not, I thought, listen to them, rather than read them? Many “serious” readers sniff at the idea of audiobooks. They are, they insist, like the Classic FM of literature. The late Harold Bloom was one such sniffer. “Deep reading really demands the inner ear as well as the outer ear,” he said. “You need the whole cognitive process, that part of you which is open to wisdom. You need the text in front of you.” For many years I, too, was a Bloomian sniffer. I still understand what he’s driving at – that reading requires effort, and is often difficult, not something to do casually while passing time on a treadmill in the gym or on the train into work. But then I started listening to audiobooks – and realised that what they do is enrich the experience of reading a book. They remind you that stories are meant to be heard as well as read, that reading and listening each allows you into the story from a different vantage point, that one enriches the experience of the other. Or, as Mantel herself puts it, “Suppose within each book there is another book, and within every letter on every page another volume constantly unfolding… Suppose the human skull were to become capacious, spaces opening inside it, humming chambers like beehives.” • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist
