My best friend and I used to date in school, but I moved to Australia for a year before university, so I ended it. Once I returned, it was clear we both still loved each other. However, he says he doesn’t want a relationship with me or anyone, but we sleep together and spend all our time together. I told him I couldn’t be his best friend as it would hurt too much to see him with other women. He says I’m his “No 1 priority”, but why won’t he commit? I’m scared to walk away from him, but what else can I do? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
