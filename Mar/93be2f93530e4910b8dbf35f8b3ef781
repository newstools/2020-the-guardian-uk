With many people forced into working from home by the current situation, the question of what to wear to the office has suddenly morphed to become what to wear to work in my kitchen, bedroom or living room. Sartorially, it can mean very different things to different people. For some it will make sense to dress even more smartly than you might to the office, via pinstripe shirts and proper shoes. For others it will mean dressing for work with your top half, the sofa with your bottom half; otherwise known by a multitude of other names: “conference call dressing”, “dressing from the top up”, “telecommutercore” and “news anchor dressing”. What about you? Show us your best WFH outfits, whatever that means to you. Are you seeing it as a chance to make any old Monday, Tuesday or Thursday, Wednesday feel like a dress-down Friday? Or a chance to practice power dressing from the confines of your front room. Or if you are one of those who has unfortunately lost their job because of the uncertainty the coronavirus has brought with it, what are you wearing to look for new jobs or update your CV?
