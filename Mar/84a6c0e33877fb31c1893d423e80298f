These drop-off dishes can be hygienically reheated (or finished off) on a stovetop, in the microwave or oven. Give the person that you’re cooking for a heads-up, set them by the front door then back at least 1.5m away. This rice dish makes for delicious leftovers, writes New Vegan columnist Meera Sodha. It’s made with capsicum (currently in-season and plentiful) and pantry-store staples, and has “a good, smoky flavour”. Cook and prep: 55 minutesHow to reheat: In the microwave A warming, Ethiopian- and Eritrean-inspired side dish from Yotam Ottolenghi, these lentils are flavoured with spice rack staples like ginger and cardamom. Take it off the stove early and leave a little extra liquid in the pot before dropping off, so your neighbour can bring the dish back to a boil themselves without sacrificing the texture.

Cook and prep: Approximately one hourHow to reheat: On a stovetop or in the microwave It may be autumn, but there are still plenty of fresh zucchinis around. Make the most of them with this traybake from Yotam Ottolenghi. It requires three stages of baking, so do the first two at home, sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top, and then drop it off so the final 15 minutes in the oven can be finished by its recipient. Cook and prep: Approximately one hourHow to reheat: Bake for 15 minutes in a 200C oven We could all use a little extra sweetness right now – and if it’s served with a healthy slug of liquor, like Thomasina Miers’ sophisticated bread pudding, all the better. This dish needs to rest for at least 30 minutes before baking, enough time to pop round the corner and drop it off at its new home. From there, the recipient can put it in the oven and enjoy the dish fresh-baked and piping hot. Prep and rest: One hourHow to reheat: Not so much reheating as cooking fresh, bake in a 180C oven for 35-40 minutes
