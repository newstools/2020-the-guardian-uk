The Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director, Fredi Bobic, has said the club would be prepared to play games every day in order to get the 2019-20 season completed once it restarts. The Bundesliga has been suspended until 2 April because of coronavirus but faces a much longer layoff and Frankfurt, like all the other clubs, are monitoring the situation and waiting for updates from the governing body as to when they can resume. Bobic, who admits it is highly unlikely any football will be played in April, told Bild: “I hope that the curve [of positive cases] will go down in the next three or four weeks. Suspending the league indefinitely would perhaps be a clever thing to do. I hope that we can finish the season, and it doesn’t matter whether that is the end of May or in June, even if we have to play a game every day.” Frankfurt are one of many clubs in Germany with players who have tested positive and Bobic, a former Germany international, is working from his flat in Frankfurt. The 48-year-old said he was surprised he was still receiving calls from agents wanting Frankfurt to sign players for next season. “I was on the phone to an agent last week and I asked him: ‘Oi, madman, what do you want from me?’ There is very little to say about transfers or contracts at the moment. I am thinking very little about new players as I am focused on the players I have at the moment and what we are doing at the moment.”
