Scottish coastal rowing, in traditional four-oared wooden boats known as St Ayles skiffs, took off in New Zealand a decade ago. The intrepid Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod joined a group of enthusiasts from NZ, Tasmania and Scotland in 2018 for an event at Great Barrier Island. They took rowing trips to various nearby islands; they fished; they swam; and they spotted wildlife, from sharks and stingrays to kingfishers and these impressive dolphins. Situated on the outer edge of the Hauraki Gulf in New Zealand’s only national marine park, Great Barrier Island is only 55 miles from Auckland.
