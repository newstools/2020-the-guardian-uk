Brighton have started an initiative for clubs in the Premier League, English Football League, Scotland and Northern Ireland to donate 1,000 tickets for future matches to frontline NHS workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Brighton’s chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber, suggested a club-to-club baton approach and nominated Bournemouth, who said they would match the offer. Barber said: “We are working on a range of things across all areas of the community and I hope this will just be the start. We fully appreciate football is the last thing on anyone’s minds at this moment, but we feel this is a small way in which we can show our gratitude for those NHS staff on the frontline who are fighting the battle on behalf of all of those and give them something to look forward to.” Bournemouth’s chairman, Jeff Mostyn, said: “We are absolutely delighted to match Brighton’s gesture and commit to one thousand tickets, and we will pass the baton to another club with the aim of reaching a significant target so football as a whole can show its appreciation for our country’s NHS workers.”
