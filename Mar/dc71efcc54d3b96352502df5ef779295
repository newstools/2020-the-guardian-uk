What’s your Sunday morning ritual? I sneak downstairs at 6am while everyone’s sleeping. I curate my radio show myself and sometimes I’ll hear something on a Saturday night and want to make last-minute changes. It takes me two seconds to get dressed. The joy of radio! I chuck on a bobble hat, puffer jacket and trainers and head to work. What does Sunday feel like? Wide-eyed and free- form. I think of the day like a Sunday paper – you go from one topic to the next. It’s why Sunday morning is such a wonderful time to be on air. People are pottering, enjoying their hobbies – so I can turn down the tempo. How do you wind down? At 1pm – show over – the team and I prepare for the following week, and then I head home to my kitchen. Cooking is my second passion – and eating sustainably. Cutting down meat is one thing, but we also need to see where our veg and fruit comes from. How does Yorkshire puddings with vegan haggis sound? What’s playing? Early blues: Jimmy Smith, Mississippi John Hurt and John Coltrane. It’s always jazz for me on a Sunday – it’s moody and thought-provoking. A favourite spot? La Bodega on Tavistock Square in Notting Hill, where you can eat delicious chorizo, tortilla and paella and watch Spanish TV. A perfect evening? Vintage films: Humphrey Bogart, Judy Garland, Hattie McDaniel. Do you miss the day off? I spent the 90s as a touring musician, rolling from gig to gig with no weekends – that was hard. But music is my passion. So my show isn’t just work – it’s part of my ritual. It’s less arduous than making sure the homework is done. The rest of Sunday is sacrosanct.
