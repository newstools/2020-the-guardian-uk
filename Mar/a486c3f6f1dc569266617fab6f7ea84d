As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures. Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with. We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart. Are you living with your new in-laws? Or quarantined with old friends? Have you been separated from your partner? Perhaps you’re regretting the decision to isolate with your significant other, or maybe you’re discovering an old flame. Tell us below.
