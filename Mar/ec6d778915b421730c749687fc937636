Bruno Fernandes has been named the Premier League player of the month for February following an exceptional start to life at Manchester United. Summer interest turned into a prolonged January pursuit for the 25-year-old Portugal midfielder, with United getting their man towards the end of the window in a deal worth an initial €55m (£46.6m). Fernandes who has hit the ground running since moving from Sporting Lisbon, also winning the PFA’s fan award for top-flight players and the club’s individual honour for February. “Since I was a kid it was a dream to play for Man Utd, and to be there at Old Trafford is the biggest dream of my career,” Fernandes said. “When you come to a new club you always want to score and the first goal is special. It doesn’t matter how the goal is scored, but important is the goal’s worth. I’m happy with my start but from now I need to give more, to be better.” It is understood Fernandes and his teammates are to return to training on Tuesday. Precautions are in place at United’s training complex because of the coronavirus pandemic but the training ground remains open. United won 5-0 against LASK on Thursday in a Europa League last-16 first leg played behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions put in place by the Austrian government. The club are waiting on Uefa’s meeting on Tuesday to find out the implications of the disease’s outbreak on the schedule, while Premier League fixtures have been suspended until early April.
