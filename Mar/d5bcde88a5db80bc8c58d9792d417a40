The Juventus forward Paulo Dybala has revealed he has tested positive for Covid-19. The Argentina forward announced on Twitter that he and his partner Oriana Sabatini had both tested positive. He is the third Juve player affected after Daniele Rugani and Blaise Matuidi. Singer and model Sabatini is the niece of former tennis player Gabriela Sabatini. Dybala wrote: “Hi everyone, I just wanted just to inform you that we have received the results for the Covid-19 test and both Oriana and I have tested positive. Luckily we are in perfect conditions. Thanks for your messages.” Milan have revealed Paolo Maldini has also tested positive for coronavirus. The club’s technical director and legendary captain received the results of a swab test on Saturday. His son Daniel, a forward in Milan’s youth team who had previously been training with the first team, also tested positive. “Paolo and Daniel are both well and have already completed two weeks at home without contact with others,” read a Milan statement. “They will now remain in quarantine until clinically recovered, as per the medical protocols outlined by the health authorities.” Four Portsmouth players – James Bolton, Andy Cannon, Sean Raggett and Haji Mnoga – have also tested positive for the virus. Pompey’s players were tested following their FA Cup defeat to Arsenal after several of the Gunners squad had been in contact with the Olympiakos owner, Evangelos Marinakis, on the night of their Europa League tie. Marinakis confirmed he had the virus on 10 March. Portsmouth’s chief executive, Mark Catlin, told the club website: “Football is not immune from this virus and I can assure you that it only really hits home when those that you know contract it.”
