Since first being recorded late last year in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. By early spring, Europe had become the worst-affected region, with Italy and Spain particularly hard hit. However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be understated for some countries. The number of deaths is sadly a more dependable indicator. Looked at by this measure we again see that the disease is hitting Italy and Spain with particular cruelty. But the trajectory in many countries is the same; the UK and US are a couple of weeks behind Italy in the progress of the epidemic. Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, although in China it seems for now to have passed its peak. In Europe most countries have closed schools, and many are in lockdown. Finally, a reminder that most people who contract the disease recover; many may never notice they had it at all.
