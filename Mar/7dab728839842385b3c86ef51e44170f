Tom Hanks says he and Rita Wilson are feeling better, two weeks after being diagnosed with coronavirus while filming in Australia. Hanks, who had been filming an Elvis biopic with director Baz Luhrmann, had been hospitalised along with Wilson after testing positive for the virus on 12 March. The pair were hospitalised, and on release self-isolated in their Australian home. pic.twitter.com/3E7566qiAh Hanks added: “Sheltering in place works like this: You don’t give it to anyone – you don’t get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take a while, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts … this, too, shall pass. We can figure this out.” The actor’s messages have become a social media sensation, particularly one that revealed his unorthodox approach to using Vegemite, after which he wrote: “I have learned not to spread my Vegemite so thick.”
