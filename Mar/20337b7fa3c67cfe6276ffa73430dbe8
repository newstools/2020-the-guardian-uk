Avalanches have killed six people in Austria in two separate incidents, police say. At least five people were swept away on Sunday morning by a large avalanche on a mountain in upper Austria. The victims were part of a group walking in snow shoes on the Dachstein range. Local police said five bodies were recovered from the avalanche, which began 2,800 metres (9,200 feet) up. The victims were thought to be from the Czech Republic, police added. Although they did not think there were other victims, mountain rescue workers were searching the site, team leader Christoph Preimesberger told the Austrian Press Agency. Also on Sunday, a 33-year-old police officer died in an avalanche in the southern Carinthia region on the Grossglockner peak. Local police said he died while taking part in a training exercise. In January 2019, about 60 residents in the town of Ramsau-am-Dachstein, which also lies in the Dachstein range, escaped another large avalanche which caused significant damage but no casualties. Also in January 2019, a sixteen-year-old Australian boy was killed in an avalanche while skiing at St Anton am Arlberg.
