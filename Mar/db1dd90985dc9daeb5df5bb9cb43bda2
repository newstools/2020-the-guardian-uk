This baobab is in Sudan, near the Kalma camp in South Darfur, which houses more than 170,000 people who have fled conflict in the region. It represents a remarkable week in my life. I am the roving correspondent for the refugee organisation Alight and last November I was at Kalma to document a group of small projects called Changemakers 365. I was staying at a guest house in Nyala, about 17km (11 miles) from the camp. Every day, I would drive to Kalma with my Sudanese colleague Mohammed, and as we passed this tree we would talk about how amazing it was, standing alone and strong, unfazed by the hot sun. At the end of the week, we walked out into the field to see it up close. We laughed as we touched it â€“ and that was the start of a beautiful friendship. It was a small moment, but an important one.
