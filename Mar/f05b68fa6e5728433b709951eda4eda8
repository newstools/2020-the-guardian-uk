Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned on Saturday that the European Union could lose its purpose if it failed to deliver a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a reacting timidly to an unprecedented economic shock. “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people,” Conte told Saturday’s edition of the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper. “We are at a critical point in European history. I represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.” The national government was said to be considering plans to extend a country-wide lockdown to mid-April. The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy was approaching. “We have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since 20 March but we are not yet in a downward phase,” ISS president Silvio Brusaferro told the Italian press agency ANSA.
