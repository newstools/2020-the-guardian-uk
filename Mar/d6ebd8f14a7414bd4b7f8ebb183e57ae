Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, 70, is a familiar face in the UK, partly through his Godolphin horse racing stable. He has strong ties with the UK, having spent time studying in Cambridge and then attending cadet school in Aldershot before returning to Dubai to help drive the emirate’s development. The billionaire sheikh is on friendly terms with the British royal family and spends a considerable amount of time at his UK residences and visiting racing events. In June last year, just over a month after initiating proceedings against Princess Haya in the high court, he received a trophy from the Queen when one of his horses won a race at Royal Ascot. The sheikh, who became crown prince of Dubai in 1995, has been credited with directing the emirate’s dramatic transformation and its international standing, including through the “Destination Dubai” tourism brand. In 2001, he announced plans for the famous Palm Jumeirah, a tree-shaped sand and rock formation, one of a number of projects aimed at attracting international visitors. An accomplished poet and horse-rider, he became ruler of Dubai after the death of his elder brother in 2006. The UAE official website hails his philanthropy and describes him as a “people’s person”. His reputation has to date largely survived revelations surrounding his racing stable’s involvement in horse-doping in 2013 and questions surrounding his role in the 2000 disappearance of his daughter Shamsa, reported first by the Guardian, and that of Latifa, who, to greater publicity, was forcibly returned to Dubai in 2018. Towards the beginning of the judgment, Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division, described the sheikh as “a man of international prominence whose position and international standing justify a high level of respect”. After McFarlane’s explosive conclusions, it is unclear whether his flattering description still holds.
