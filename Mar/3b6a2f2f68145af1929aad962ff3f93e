As with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak. Please recommend your favourites with a view to informing readers; we are not seeking to promote outings in the near future that may pose any health risk. The UK is blessed with wonderful nature reserves managed by the RSPB, wildlife trusts, local authorities and the National Trust (free-to-enter sites should still be open; check online). You may be a keen birdwatcher or more into amphibians, reptiles, flora or invertebrates. Whatever your level of expertise – even if you just love a stroll in beautiful surroundings – please share details of your favourite protected areas. Include any special sightings you may have experienced. Please tell us exact locations, website and entry fee where appropriate. Feel free to mention any particularly good facilities on site. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words. We’re looking for UK entries only this week please.
