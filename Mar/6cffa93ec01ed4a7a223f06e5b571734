As someone reading a news site right now, you know as well as anyone that bad things are happening everywhere. China, North and South Korea and Iran are all in major lockdown, with Italy in plans to quarantine more than 16 million people as coronavirus spreads like wildfire across the globe. The US election news cycle already feels overwhelmingly relentless – literally eight whole months before the actual vote. And Australia has careened from one existential threat to another, with barely a break to buy replacement face masks using money that may no longer exist. It makes sense to turn off the news and stay indoors. In fact some people might not get to choose. But if you are curling up with a book, the last thing you need is one that brings it all back up: the floods, the fires, the pestilence, the wars; the powerful people evading justice; the rise of the far right, the fall of the markets, the devaluation of journalism at a time we need it most. Guardian Australia sent an email around the office asking for recommendations of good books that make us feel good. Books about none of that other stuff. Books that we can really, truly escape into. Please add your own in the comments. - By Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (Penguin) It might seem odd to seek solace in a book about the apocalypse. But Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and the late great Terry Pratchett, is such a nice and funny book that the end of the world feels quite a cheery affair. There is also an excellent audiobook version, and a BBC radio play, and an excellent short television series starring a well-waistcoated Michael Sheen and extremely ginger David Tenant, so you can distract yourself for a good long while by trying out all the different media. And when the end of the world inevitably does not come, you can do lunch at the Ritz. – Calla Wahlquist, reporter - By Georgette Heyer (Penguin) I always find my Terry Pratchett collection a good fallback – his satire is done in a way that gives some hope and joy through the characters’ foibles and triumphs. Then there’s the Regency romances of Georgette Heyer (and her legions of imitators since) when one really just does want some froth and bubble choreographed with bustles and millinery with a wedding at the end. – Viv Smythe, digital community team - By Ben Aaranovitch (Victor Gollancz) When I get home from making a news podcast every day I usually just want to escape the news – so I love reading things completely unrelated to what’s going on. I read a lot of sci-fi and crime fiction and have recently enjoyed Ben Aaranovitch’s Rivers of London series, which is kind of like what if Harry Potter was a police officer in modern day London. It mixes a detailed police procedural plot with magic and a good amount of humour. Ex-Doctor Who writer Aranovitch is also always trying to make the city of London a character, using the geography of the city as part of each plotline. If you keep reading the series it strikes a good balance between welcoming you back to familiar characters but making sure they all change over time and don’t become stale. – Miles Martignoni, head of audio - By Robert L. Heilbroner (Penguin) My read of the noughties so far has been The Worldly Philosophers, a book about … economics. Stay with me! The topic sounds dry as dust but this is a lively and surprisingly engaging run through the life stories of the big economic thinkers, from Smith to Keynes and beyond, and will also give you a solid understanding of their theories. Have a hunt around for the 10th and final edition, published in 1998. You’ll be rewarded with a realisation of the stupidity of becoming hidebound to one particular school of economic thought – sadly, in my view, a trait in great evidence amongst our leaders. Anyone who presumes to talk about economics with any authority should read it. – Warren Murray, global fronts editor - By Elizabeth Gilbert (Bloomsbury) Last year, a friend told me – in no uncertain terms – to stop reading books about bad men. Instead, she gave me this: a sprawling, vivid and absorbing novel about a woman scientist in the early 1800s who is heaps into moss. Alma Whittaker is no-nonsense, analytical and perplexed by human behaviour. Born to a very wealthy botanist, she is able to channel her energy not into marriage but into moss instead – namely how and where it grows, and what it can tell us about the evolution of man. She studies it relentlessly for decades before sailing around the world to Tahiti, where the moss is even better. Alma may be a woman in a man’s world, but this isn’t about gender; it’s about genius, dedication and exploration, and the pursuit of truths both expansive and personal. It’s also about moss. – Steph Harmon, culture editor - By Neil Gaiman (Hachette) A captured heart, a fallen star, adventure, pirates, witches and love. What more could you want when looking from an escape from reality? Stardust by Neil Gaiman may be just an adult fairytale, but it’s the perfect antidote to the ennui which strikes when life becomes all too real. We may gaze at the stars, but it’s wonderful to imagine, if only for a few moments, what could happen if they gazed back. – Amy Remeikis, political reporter - We want to build a comprehensive reading list of books that won’t draw us back into the real world.
