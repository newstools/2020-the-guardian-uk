Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is suing CNN for publishing an opinion piece that argued Trump did not stop Russia from helping the campaign during the presidential election. The libel lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the northern district of Georgia, argues that CNN published the story on the campaign’s Russia ties despite “an extensive record of statements from the campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance”. Trump’s campaign has also filed libel lawsuits against the Washington Post and the New York Times in the past few weeks. Those lawsuits, similarly, were over opinion articles about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The CNN article was written by Larry Noble, a CNN contributor and former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission. It was published in the opinion section of CNN’s website. It argued that Trump’s campaign “assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia’s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table”. Fox News first reported the lawsuit on Friday. Trump’s legal team demanded CNN retract the op-ed and issue a correction but the network declined. The article is still up on CNN’s website. The Trump campaign is seeking millions of dollars in its lawsuit. “The campaign therefore was left with no alternative but to file this lawsuit to: publicly establish the truth, properly inform CNN’s readers and audience (and the rest of the world) of the true facts, and seek appropriate remedies for the harm caused by CNN’s false reporting and failure to retract and apologize for it,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit is the latest example of the antagonistic relationship Trump’s team and the president himself has had with the network and the press at large. Trump regularly rants about CNN and its “fake news” coverage of him and his administration.
