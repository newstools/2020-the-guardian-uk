It is important to maintain perspective on the situation that we are in (London pubs, cinemas and gyms may close in Covid-19 clampdown, 20 March). As serious as the Covid-19 virus is going to be terms of its immediate impact for all of us, the longer-term consequences are likely going to be as great in psychological as well as in economic terms. Perspective is pivotal at this time. The majority of us will wake up each morning with no temperature and no cough. Each day we must look out for those who are alone, elderly and vulnerable. If we have symptoms of infection, we must stay at home. One of the greatest human characteristics is optimism. As much as this virus is dangerous, spring might just slow its spread.Dr Adrian HealdConsultant physician (NHS), Salford Royal hospital
