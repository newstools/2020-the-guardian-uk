It is remiss of you not to have mentioned the Mountain Bothies Association in your article by Geoff Allan (High and Dry, Travel, 29 February). The MBA is a Scottish charity with a simple mission: to maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places. At least six of the seven bothies mentioned in the article are maintained by the MBA. It spends around £100,000 per annum and 1,000 hours of volunteer time on maintaining bothies throughout the UK, mainly in Scotland. The charity is funded by the subscriptions of approximately 4,000 members, and other generous donors. The bothies themselves are usually owned by others, who have agreed to allow them to be maintained by the MBA for use by all. We ask that users respect the Bothy Code which can be found here. There is no bothy fairy that makes these things magically appear in the landscape.Graham JumpGuildford, Surrey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
