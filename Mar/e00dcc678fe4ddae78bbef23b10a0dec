A 91-year-old woman has died after she and four other people were attacked by three dogs on the New South Wales south coast. The incident occurred at Collingwood beach at Vincentia about 7am on Sunday. All five suffered cuts and bite marks, and the woman died at the scene after sustaining serious injuries. The other four people – three women and a man – were taken to Shoalhaven district hospital. They were later reported to be in a stable condition. Police later said one of the women was the 71-year-old daughter of the 91-year-old woman. Supt Greg Moore, the commander of the south coast police district, praised the bravery of witnesses and emergency services who went to help the victims and contain the dogs. He said police were advised the dogs were a bull mastiff-cross breed and officers were investigating if criminal charges should be laid against the owners. Faye Stockman of NSW ambulance said the 91-year-old had multiple injuries to both arms and both legs. The initial concern was for paramedics and their safety, she said, noting that multiple people came to the group’s assistance. The three dogs were seized by Shoalhaven council rangers and arrangements were being made to have them euthanased.
