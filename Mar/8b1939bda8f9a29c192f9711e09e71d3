Given that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant. So this week we want you tell us about a souvenir or memento you picked up on your travels that has a special place in your heart or still brings a smile to your face. It could evoke happy memories of the trip itself, or be all about the place you bought it – a magical shop, a colourful market stall or the even more colourful owner. Perhaps it’s a unique, beautiful artefact that now has pride of place in your home. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words. Have a look at our past winners and other tips We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. It is the text that our judges will consider, but this week a good photo will certainly improve your chances, be it one taken on the trip or a more recent nicely composed shot of your treasure. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The prize is £200 for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK or Europe and the prize will now be valid for 18 months from when the winner receives notification. The winner will be chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel.
