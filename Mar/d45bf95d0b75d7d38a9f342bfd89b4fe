During the coronavirus emergency, could we not adopt the Japanese practice of bowing rather than shaking hands? Instead of the Monty Python contortions being awkwardly attempted by public figures, we could have the most graceful, civilised and respectful greeting that there is. The bow used by the Japanese when meeting friends and social equals is just a slight inclination of the upper body.It is easy and natural to do. It looks good and there is no bodily contact.Wilko JohnsonWestcliff-on-Sea, Essex • With all the measures to self-isolate, it’s unfortunate that we are hearing about people needing to stay indoors. It’s important to remember that 39% of the UK population is vitamin D deficient at this time of year. While it won’t stop the Covid-19 infection, there’s some good evidence that vitamin D can protect against respiratory infection, especially if you lack it. It certainly can’t do any harm in small doses. So we need both sunlight and regular supplements – at least until the summer.Mark PerryFormer GP, Didsbury, Manchester • Harking back to war analogies and a blitz spirit is dangerous (Why the cruel myth of the ‘blitz spirit’ is no model for how to fight coronavirus, 19 March). If someone chooses to go out and about in a bombing raid, it alters the odds on them getting hit. But it doesn’t change the odds for anyone else. With Covid-19, individual choices not only impact your own chance of being hit, but can also seriously alter the chances of others being hit. And they can increase the chance of the health system being unable to respond to those in need. Anyone tempted to carry on regardless should recognise the consequences for others.Jane MardellLittle Bealings, Suffolk
