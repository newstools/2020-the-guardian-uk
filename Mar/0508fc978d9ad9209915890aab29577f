Is the coronavirus more scary if it’s called a “pandemic” rather than an “epidemic”? And what exactly is the difference? The “-demic” part comes from “demos”, the Greek for “people” (hence also democracy). An epidemic is something visited “on the people”: a sickness such as influenza, or the plague, that spreads among a population at a particular time. A pandemic, meanwhile, afflicts “all peoples”, and so is what epidemiologists define as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”. The World Health Organization adds that, in a pandemic proper, “almost simultaneous transmission takes place worldwide”. Britain’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, inspired his usual level of public confidence by saying that the virus would definitely become “endemic” in the UK: a gloomy prognosis, since an “endemic” disease (“within the people”) is one that has taken up permanent residence in a population, such as chickenpox. Or perhaps he was confusing his words, since he also said Covid-19 was already “endemic” in other countries: it’s certainly epidemic in China, but no one knows yet whether Covid-19 will become endemic, having been discovered only last December. One hopes this degree of pessimism is not endemic to the government. Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.
