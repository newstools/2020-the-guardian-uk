Britain may be leaving Europe, but the Guardian is not. Today, we are making a deeper commitment to our coverage of European affairs. This is a critical moment in history where disengagement, introspection and national self-interest are big risks. We want to bridge the gap. And we want your advice. Does scrutiny of the EU become more or less important? What are the pressing issues that affect us all that you feel we should prioritise? Should we continue to focus on fraught Anglo-European relations, or move on and focus more on the shared problems across Europe? ? And what about hope? Do you want stories that consistently point up what is going wrong in Europe, or would you like to see an accent on optimism, the things that Europe – or countries within Europe – do well, that can offer lessons for the rest of the world? It is likely you will see more journalism from and about Europe on our website, including in a dedicated space on our international digital front page. This is your chance to tell us what you would like to see. Please share your views and experiences in the encrypted form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses. One of our journalists may be in touch to discuss your submission further. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
