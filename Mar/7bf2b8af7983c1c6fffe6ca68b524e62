First of all, many apologies to readers who contributed to last week’s assignment on wildlife reserves, but we’ve had to postpone its publication given the Covid-19 crisis and government warnings on social distancing and travel. There will still be a winner, who will be notified when the article is eventually published. We’re living in unprecedented times, and confined to our homes for the near future. So, this week we are asking for reminiscences of great holiday locations – places that you are looking forward to visiting again one day. Hopefully, it will be comforting for many of you to recall special holidays and the wonderful places you’ve visited – anywhere in the world. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words. Have a look at our past winners and other tips We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are very welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The prize is £200 for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK or Europe and the prize will now be valid for 18 months from when the winner receives notification. The winner will be chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel.
