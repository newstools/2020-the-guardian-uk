Lungi Ngidi’s blistering haul and an unbeaten century from Janneman Malan helped South Africa to a dominant six-wicket victory over Australia in Bloemfontein as they clinched the One-Day International series. The Proteas, who won the opening match at Paarl by 74 runs, bowled Australia out for 271, with Ngidi claiming six wickets. David Warner made 35 off 23 balls, before Ngidi also dismissed Steve Smith (13) and Marnus Labuschagne for a golden duck, from successive balls in the 13th over. Australia captain Aaron Finch, who had elected to to bat first, and D’Arcy Short both hit 69 to help push the tourists on towards a respectable total. Ngidi finished with his ODI best figures of six for 58, which was the second-best bowling figures for a South African in an ODI, while Anrich Nortje also took two wickets at the Mangaung Oval. Although South Africa lost captain Quinton de Kock for a duck, bowled by Mitchell Starc just three balls into the reply, opener Malan - in just his second ODI - soon steadied the innings. JJ Smuts weighed in with 41 as the home side reached 92 for two in the 21st over. Heinrich Klaasen’s rapid 51 – which included three fours and a six – helped push South Africa towards the victory target. Malan’s superb innings closed unbeaten on 129, with seven boundaries and four sixes. David Miller finished 37 not out. The teams meet again in Potchefstroom on Saturday.
