Wolves have hit form and are three points off fourth place after a brilliant win over Tottenham and as such the Champions League feels tantalisingly close. Why settle for fourth though? Leicester’s recent struggles suggest third is still up for grabs and victory over Brighton would be an ideal way to start hauling them in. Wolves will have to try and do so without Adama Traoré’s venomous pace and power which will undoubtedly be a relief for Graham Potter’s defence. Struggling Brighton sit a single point above relegation and are still winless this year. Relegation beckons on current form.
