Two men have been targeted in paramilitary-style attacks in separate incidents in Derry and Ballymena. In the first attack, a man in his 30s was shot in the leg, which police said had “all the hallmarks of a paramilitary-style shooting”. Three masked men were involved in the attack in the Magowan Park area of Creggan, Derry, on Wednesday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. DS Gavin McLaughlin said the incident took place at around 11pm and said it was a “planned, vicious and brutal attack, which is completely unacceptable in today’s society”. The victim has been taken to hospital for treatment and anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111. The Sinn Féin MLA, Karen Mullan, condemned the shooting.“There is no place for attacks like this in our society and those responsible are not representative of the local community,” she said. “This comes at a time when our medical staff are under intense pressure and the community is dealing with the biggest public health crisis it has ever faced. “Whoever did this needs to listen to the people of the area and end these attacks immediately.” Meanwhile in Ballymena, Co Antrim, a 25-year-old man was subjected to a suspected paramilitary-style assault, police said.The man was attacked by five masked men in the Casement Street area, at least one of whom was armed with a machete, just before midnight. DS Peter Crothers said: “The victim was taken to hospital for treatment of injuries to his head. “This was a vicious and brutal assault, which we are treating as a paramilitary-style attack at this time. We must all work together to bring those responsible to justice and stop this from happening to anyone else. “We are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident, or has information they think could assist this investigation, to contact police on 101.”
