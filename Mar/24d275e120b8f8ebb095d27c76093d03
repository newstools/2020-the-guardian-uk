Hospitals in Italy’s central and southern regions are bracing themselves as the number confirmed coronavirus cases in the region grow daily. The rise, which has been particularly dramatic in Lazio, Campania and Puglia, is believed to mostly be due to the thousands who fled to the south after Lombardy, where the outbreak in Italy began, was quarantined on 8 March. The entire country was put under lockdown on 9 March, with rules tightened on the 11 March. Deaths across the whole country rose to 3,405 on Thursday, overtaking China as the country with the most fatalities in the pandemic. “Looking at the situation in central and southern Italy, you see cases increasing, especially over the last few days,” said Giorgio Sestili, a physicist who is collating studies from Italian scientists and sharing them on the Facebook page, Coronavirus – Data and Scientific Analysis. “We think this could be due to the many people from the north who travelled south after the 9 March lockdown, and who might have transferred the virus.” According to data from Italy’s civil protection authority, there were 823 cases of Covid-19 in Lazio as of Thursday night, compared to 102 on 9 March. In Campania, cases rose from 120 to 652 in 10 days, in Puglia from 50 to 478, in Sicily from 54 to 340, in Calabria from 11 to 169, and in the central Abruzzo region, from 30 to 385. Governors of several southern regions have asked for their borders to effectively be closed-off, while in Sicily and Naples soldiers will patrol the streets to ensure citizens are complying with quarantine rules. The Sicilian government has stopped all flights, with the exception of two daily flights between Rome and the cities of Palermo and Catania, after 30,000 people landed from the north in the space of a week. Some 15,000 also fled to their families in Puglia. Compared to better equipped hospitals in the richer north, there are fears that hospitals in the south could struggle to cope with an escalation in cases. The health system in the south has been blighted by cost-cutting, with over 40 hospitals closing in recent years. In preparation, authorities in Campania have converted two hospitals in between Naples and Salerno for the treatment of Covid-19, which would increase the number of intensive care beds in the region to over the current 600. “But the problem is that Campania could become a point of reference for other regions in the south that don’t have much capacity,” said Dr Serena Masino, a lecturer in economics and international development at the University of Westminster in London who has spoken to doctors in the south as part of research. “Doctors there are very concerned about a lack of equipment. As of Wednesday, we still had doctors in the main Covid-19 hospitals in Naples without face masks. One doctor had been using the same one for three days. The other concern is family doctors – in Calabria, they received masks and goggles last week, but in Campania, as of Wednesday, they had nothing.” Doctors are also calling for testing for the virus to be ramped up in the south, especially among medical workers, after aggressive testing in Vo’ Euganeo, a town in Veneto where the first person in Italy died of coronavirus, halted the illness. Giuseppe Craparo, a doctor in Palermo, said hospitals in the south were bracing themselves for a “massive tsunami” of coronavirus patients. “We live in a state of perpetual anticipation, tension and fear,” he added. “Our goal is to attempt to spread the number of cases over time. In recent days, we’ve only been carrying out emergency operations and were asked not to perform any routine surgical operations in order to leave the intensive care ward as open as possible.” Pasquale Gallerano, a physician at a hospital in Sciacca, a town in the Sicilian province of Agrigento, said about a dozen cases had so far emerged. “But if we experience an outbreak of the magnitude in the north, we will face enormous pressures,” he added. “We currently have no space in intensive care and are already sending Covid-19 patients to Palermo.” Cases of the virus rose across Italy to 41,035 on Thursday, including 4,440 people who have recovered. “The next few days will still be very difficult,” said Sestili. “But the fundamental thing over the next few weeks will be how the regions in the centre-south perform, because if we succeed in keeping it under control there, we can hope for a positive outcome.”
