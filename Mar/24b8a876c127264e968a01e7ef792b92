I used to run a variety show in Chicago called Entertaining Julia and one time Robin Williams stopped by and did a surprise set. He ditched the material he had been touring and mostly just improvised for an hour to a packed bar full of young comics. Eddie Murphy’s White Like Me on SNL is pretty hard to top. The way British people pronounce “yoghurt”. US comedian Mark Normand: “Why is everyone afraid to die alone? I’m afraid to die in a group.” I once had vegetarian shark fin soup. It didn’t really taste like anything but maybe there’s something funny about vegetarians who still crave shark fin? I was living in Santiago, Chile, and a friend told me you’re not really a local until you get your hair cut in the place you’re living. So I got a haircut and must have miscommunicated the style I wanted in Spanish because I ended up with a legit mullet. On the bright side, after that people stopped assuming I was American. Those poor people who have that clinical disorder where they can’t stop orgasming. I don’t know why they ever agree to talk about it on camera.
