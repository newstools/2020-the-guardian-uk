I have bittersweet memories of the National Housewives’ Register (G2, 27 February). Sometime around 1971, my friend Roy’s wife asked if I’d speak at a meeting of the local branch in High Wycombe.

Up ’ere, of course, vowels are flatter.Ann Hudson Prestwich, Manchester • At my east Midlands Sunday school, aged five, I was taught the same song, but heard “damn settee”. My Catholic granny wasn’t pleased!
