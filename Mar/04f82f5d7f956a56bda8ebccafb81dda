I am concerned that your article on the exhibition to be held at RAF Duxford (Report, 10 March) makes no mention of the crucial contribution made by Polish pilots in the Battle of Britain. I hope that’s not because it’s not mentioned in the exhibition either. We need to remember that the Poles have made a far greater contribution to Britain’s survival and culture than just a few exotic grocers’ shops.

What could Freeman Dyson have meant if he claimed that “the universe must in some sense have known that we were coming”? Only sentient beings can know things. What does “in some sense” mean? In what sense?Edward GreenwoodCanterbury, Kent • It won’t have escaped many Mancunians’ notice that the “boarded-up pub building” pictured in the Journal (9 March) used to be called The Bank of England.Roy PalmerBroadbottom, Greater Manchester • I was impressed to learn from your Pet corner quiz that Albert Schweitzer had a cat who could write while asleep (10 March).
