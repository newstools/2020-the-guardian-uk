Leslie Baruch Brent was not only an eminent immunologist, but also a kind, generous and altogether lovely man known to those of us involved in Jewish anti-Occupation politics. Leslie maintained a deep commitment to human rights, which, for him, included the rights of Palestinians. He was an early member of Jews for Justice for Palestinians and a frequent attender at our meetings and events. He also supported our sister charity, the British Shalom-Salaam Trust.
