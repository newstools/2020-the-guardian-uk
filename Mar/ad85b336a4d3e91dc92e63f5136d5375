Mikel Arteta is well on the road to recovery after being diagnosed with coronavirus a week ago and Arsenal’s training facilities have reopened for everyday maintenance after a deep clean. Around 100 Arsenal personnel, including the first-team squad and coaching staff, have been self-isolating since Arteta’s positive test. They are set to return to training next Tuesday but that looks far from certain now the Premier League will not resume before 30 April. The club are working through the implications of that decision for their day-to-day schedule, a process made difficult by the fast-moving wider situation dictating events. Arteta is communicating from home with colleagues. “We’re pleased to say Mikel is feeling much better,” read part of a lengthy open letter to Arsenal supporters in the name of directors, players and staff. “He’s in good spirits, doing detailed planning with the coaches and speaking to the players regularly.” A small workforce is maintaining the London Colney and Hale End training centres’ pitches and facilities for whenever training gets the go-ahead. The Arsenal women’s and academy teams are also staying at home. Arsenal pledged their support to the local community, in Islington, during the coronavirus outbreak. Discussions about ways to support the area’s more vulnerable groups have included the potential for online coaching and teaching, and staff volunteering to have regular phone contact with elderly people who feel isolated. The club is also looking at ways to support its many casual workers. The Premier League’s decision about the season’s immediate future has Arsenal’s full support. Their managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, and head of football, Raul Sanllehi, participated in Thursday’s conference call between the league and its 20 clubs. Arsenal face a backlog of at least six top-flight games, plus an FA Cup quarter-final with Sheffield United, when some semblance of normality returns.
