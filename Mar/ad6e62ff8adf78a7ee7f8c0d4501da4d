Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has addressed the nation, asking Kiwis to “be strong, be kind” during an unprecedented global crisis. “Please take it seriously, this is about saving lives,” Ardern said. There are 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand, with two of them having no links to overseas travel – meaning the virus may now be being passed on via community transmission, something health authorities said they were urgently exploring. Ardern asked New Zealanders to cancel any non-essential travel around the country, and for those aged 70 or over, or with a compromised immune system, to stay home for the foreseeable future. Her deputy prime minister Winston Peters, aged 74, was exempt as he was “essential”, Ardern said. Anyone who could work from home should now do so, Ardern said, and then reassured Kiwis that essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open throughout. If you cannot go out and maintain two metres of distance, then don’t go out, Ardern said. “Over the past few weeks, the world has changed. And it has changed very quickly.” Ardern said, speaking from her parliamentary office in Wellington. “We are experiencing an unprecedented event – a global pandemic that in New Zealand, we have moved to fight by going hard, and going early.”“I understand that all of this rapid change creates anxiety, and uncertainty. Especially when it means changing how we live. “The first really important thing to remember, is that the vast majority of people who will ever have Covid-19 will only experience mild to moderate symptoms. But there will be some who need more care.“That’s why we have to focus on one simple goal – to slow down Covid-19,” Ardern said. Slowing it down would mean having “smaller waves” of the virus circulating, to reduce the impact on health, jobs and and the economy. Ardern said “some countries have successfully managed to do this” and the goal now was slowing, not stopping, the virus. The prime minister also introduced a four-level alert system, with New Zealand currently at level two. “Alert Level Two is where the disease is contained but the risks are growing because we have more cases,” Ardern said. “This is when we move to reduce our contact with one another. We increase our border measures, and we cancel events. This is also the level where we ask people to work differently if they can, and cancel unnecessary travel.” Level four, the highest level, would mean transmission through the community was “sustained”. At this stage “we eliminate contact with each other altogether”, Ardern said, as seen in Italy and France. The government would “keep essential services going, but ask everyone to stay at home until Covid-19 is back under control”. Different areas of the country could move to different alert levels at different stages and times. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, director general of health, said it was wise for people to stay home at the moment, limit their social contact and not travel domestically at all if they didn’t really need too. Air New Zealand would be booking plane tickets with seats between passengers to limit contact. Despite some health experts pressing for school closures and other level four measures, the prime minister said schools would open as normal on Monday, despite many parents already choosing to keep their children home. Many tertiary institutions are now moving to teach students online, while most workplaces are testing, phasing in or adopting work from home practices. Kiwis praised Ardern’s national address, describing it as calm and reassuring. After watching that update I’m so grateful we have Jacinda leading the country through this. She was clear, calm, and compassionate. Look after one another please 🙌🏾 https://t.co/4cR9WQGhxE As soon as Jacinda started talking, I started crying ❤ Jacinda Ardern is clearly an amazing communicator but that is an understatement of her as PM.She has the intellectual heft to distill and test large amounts of information and advice to make decisions in the public interest. We are so lucky to have her in these testing times❤️
