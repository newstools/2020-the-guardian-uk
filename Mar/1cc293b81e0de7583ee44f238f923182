There seems little doubt that we will be facing a mental health crisis as the pandemic affects people’s lives and minds (Is there a right way to worry about coronavirus? And other mental health tips, 19 March). Saneline, our telephone helpline, is under severe pressure from people with depression, anxiety and other conditions. We are now making arrangements so that our trained volunteers will be able to call them back. Already 80% of our callers talk about self-harm and suicide, and we fear that if they are unable to reach us or find other help then they may be tipped over the edge. For some people, four months at home may seem like a challenge, but for those with no real home, or living in a substandard flat, as many of our callers are, isolation can be hell. The funds released for coronavirus must be spent on mental as well as physical health and prevention.Marjorie WallaceChief executive, Sane • Listening to music for 30 minutes a day has been found to lower levels of anxiety (G2, 23 March). I have started listening to a classic album a day, yesterday’s being Joni Mitchell’s Court and Spark. Suggestions for future listening gratefully received.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire • It is heartening to experience the resurgence, despite distancing, of community feeling during the Covid-19 crisis. A month ago we lived in communities, alone; now we are beginning to live alone, but in community. As we discover and react to need, this offers hope.David Cragg-JamesStonegrave, North Yorkshire
