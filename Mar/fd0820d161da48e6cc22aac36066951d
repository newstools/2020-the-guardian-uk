England women’s cricket captain Heather Knight has revealed she has signed up for the NHS volunteer scheme launched to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday the government launched an appeal for 250,000 volunteers to help with duties such as delivering medicines from pharmacies, driving patients to and from doctors’ appointments or hospitals, and making phone calls to check on people isolating at home. So far more than 700,000 have signed up, including Knight, who returned to England from Australia after the T20 World Cup 10 days ago. “I have a lot of free time on my hands and I want to help as much as I can,” Knight said. “My brother and his partner are doctors, and I have a few friends who work in the NHS, so I know how hard they are working and how difficult it is for everyone. “I’m going to get the car out as I’ve volunteered to transport medicine, and also speak to people who are self-isolating. If someone is home alone, you can ring them up and chat. They have had so many people sign up.”
