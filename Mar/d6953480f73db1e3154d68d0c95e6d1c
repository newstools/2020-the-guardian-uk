The Premier League is discussing contingency plans regarding playing matches behind closed doors should the threat of coronavirus lead to mass gatherings being banned. Although the league will continue to be led by government policy on health and will not take any immediate decisions, talks are continuing to ensure the season can be completed. Coronavirus is yet to become widespread in the United Kingdom but matches in Italy’s Serie A have been disrupted by the disease, with six being postponed at the weekend. The Football Association has to consider England’s friendly with Italy, which is due to be played on 27 March at Wembley. In line with current government advice the fixture would be expected to go ahead.
