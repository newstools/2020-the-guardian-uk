Joe Biden has vowed to choose a woman as his running mate if he wins the Democratic presidential nomination. “There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow,” Biden said during the first one-on-one Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night, where the former vice-president faced off against the progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. “I would pick a woman to be my vice-president,” Biden said. Biden also reiterated his promise to make his first nominee to the supreme court an African American woman, which would be a first for the country. Sanders declined to explicitly commit to choosing a woman as his running mate after Biden said he would. “In all likelihood, I will,” Sanders said when asked. “My very strong tendency is to move in that direction.” Sanders said it was important to him to choose a progressive running mate, and said there were progressive women to choose from.
