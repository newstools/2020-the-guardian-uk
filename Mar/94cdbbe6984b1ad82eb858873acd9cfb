In Katie Mitchell’s recent staging of Bartók’s only opera, Bluebeard’s Castle is renamed after its female protagonist. Mitchell prefaces it with a performance of the composer’s Concerto for Orchestra, which becomes the accompaniment to the screening of a film presenting the backstory to her treatment of the narrative. Translated to contemporary London, the central character is now a police detective, sung by Nina Stemme, who takes on the name Judith when she poses as an escort to trap a serial killer preying on sex workers, drugging and imprisoning them at his home. The opera proper begins on stage (without its spoken prologue) when Bluebeard (John Lundgren) and Judith arrive back at his house. As an exercise in dramatic repackaging the production is hard to fault; it’s imaginatively conceived and expertly realised, and superbly sung and acted by Stemme and Lundgren, even if his baritone is not as dark-hued as it might be for the role. But Mitchell’s treatment is essentially reductive. “Judith” may get her man in the end, bringing closure to the drama, but the ambiguity at the heart of the opera as Bartók conceived it is destroyed, turning a piece of symbolist music theatre, with a profoundly troubled and troubling central character, into an all-too-familiar TV-style police hunt for a sadomasochistic killer.
