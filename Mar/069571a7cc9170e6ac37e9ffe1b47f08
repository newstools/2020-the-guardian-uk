Alisson will miss Liverpool’s crucial Champions League second leg against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday and could be sidelined by a hip injury until after the international break, Jürgen Klopp has confirmed. Liverpool’s commanding goalkeeper suffered the injury in training before the FA Cup defeat at Chelsea. The Brazil international was due to be on the bench at Stamford Bridge where his replacement, Adrián, made a costly mistake for Willian’s opening goal. Klopp said Alisson would not be available for Saturday’s Premier League game at home to Bournemouth or the last-16 return against Atlético, who hold a 1-0 lead over the European champions. The 27-year-old is also doubtful for the derby at Everton on 16 March. “Unfortunately Ali is out,” Klopp said. “He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway; the plan was he was on the bench. “There, we thought: ‘Come on, we don’t have to take any risks’ so left him out of the squad. [There was a] scan the next day and they found something so now he is out. It is a muscle, slight, in the hip region. A small muscle.” Asked to confirm the length of the goalkeeper’s absence, the Liverpool manager said: “Next week no, that means Atlético. I don’t want to say no [to the Everton game] but I don’t know if he will be available. He is not available for tomorrow and then the next week. We have to judge the situation anew. I would say after the international break 100%. Whatever we can get before that we will see.”
