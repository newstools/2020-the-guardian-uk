Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We’ve set up a WhatsApp group for the terraced road we live in as a community support group during the coronavirus crisis. What are the upbeat things we can share – and do – to keep our spirits up, while of course observing all the social distancing rules? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
