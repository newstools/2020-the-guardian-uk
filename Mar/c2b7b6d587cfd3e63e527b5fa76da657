We are living in extraordinary times and coronavirus has meant that for many life as we know it has changed exponentially in a matter of weeks. Things may never be quite the same again. Change is being felt in all areas of our lives, from what we eat to who we socialise with and how we spend our time. What is the biggest lifestyle change that you have made as a result of the Covid-19 epidemic and how is it impacting on your daily life? Perhaps you have given up smoking as a result of health advice; taken up running or 80s aerobics routines because of limitations to exercise; changed your diet for the better; started volunteering in your neighbourhood and made new friends along the way. We look forward to hearing your stories of coronavirus-inspired change. You can get in touch by filling in the form below.
