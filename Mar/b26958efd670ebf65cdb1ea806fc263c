London’s Tate Modern, in the former Bankside power station, is one of the most famous examples of a building reinvented for a radically different use, but the recycling of an old unique space often brings extra value – especially when it celebrates its history, rather than hiding it – and can help revitalise a neighbourhood, too. We’d love to hear about repurposed architecture you’ve enjoyed in the UK and Europe. It doesn’t have to be a recent project – the magnificent Siracusa cathedral in Sicily was originally a Greek temple, and was a mosque for couple of centuries, too.
