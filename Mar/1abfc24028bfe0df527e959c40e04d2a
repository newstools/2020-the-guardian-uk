It could be a National Trust property or an area of protected countryside vibrant with wildflowers and birdsong, a village that comes to life in spring, a gallery or museum opening up after the winter. We’d like to hear about any place – rural or urban – you like to visit that has a special allure as the weather improves, or perhaps a small, fun festival. We’re looking for UK entries only this week please. Tell us about your favourite, including exact location and website where appropriate. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words.
