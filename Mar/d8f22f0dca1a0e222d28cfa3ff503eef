A renowned expert has come to the University of Cambridge to deliver a lecture on his specialist subject. It’s title? Hysteria: the Wandering Womb. He takes questions from the floor, but only from the men. When a young female student raises a point, the lecturer shouts, gesticulates and demands she leaves the room; anyone would be forgiven for thinking he was hysterical. It is 1896. The scene neatly encapsulates Jessica Swale’s theme: the battle fought by the staff and students of Girton College for the right of women to sit for degrees, rather than just tag along to courses of study. This subject matter is part of the reason why Swale’s 2013 debut play has become a classroom classic. It demonstrates ways in which these “blue stockings”, as they were derisively known, have to deal with appalling levels of prejudice from the men around them (a couple of honourable exceptions aside). It also shows them having to struggle with their own competing desires: for learning, romantic yearnings and family. At times, the writing presents the issues too starkly, over-emphatically and repetitively, tilting the balance of the piece from drama towards educative exercise. Cutting would sharpen its points. A 16-strong cast, made up mostly of actors from Storyhouse’s Young Company, brings terrific energy to the production. Yukiko Masui’s movement direction swirls scenes on to and around Adam Wiltshire’s evocative design – its skeletal wooden frame suggests lecture halls, student residences and a night-time orchard. Under Elle While’s crisp direction, the young actors bring a well-focused clarity to the students’ interactions. Lecturer allies Natasha Bain and Tom Davey subtly express the private and professional costs of supporting the women in a battle for equality that is still being fought today. • At Storyhouse, Chester, until 15 March
