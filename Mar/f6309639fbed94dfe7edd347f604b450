It is good to hear of local initiatives springing up to help the many older people who will self-isolate to reduce the risk of a coronavirus infection that would be so much more serious for them than for younger people (Charities rally to help the elderly in self-isolation, 7 March). But what we need is a systematic effort, particularly during the weeks the contagion is forecast to peak, when NHS staff will be so stretched. Volunteers could be organised to draw up registers of isolated people at risk of not getting the deliveries they need, and deliver supplies to them or arrange for supermarket deliveries to those without computers. Volunteers who have had the illness could provide care to the sick and those slowly recovering. Relying on helpful neighbours and occasional groups is too hit and miss.Marion ShoardAuthor, How to Handle Later Life • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
