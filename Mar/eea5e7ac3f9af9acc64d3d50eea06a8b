In the spring of 1973 I was a student organiser of the Mayfly festival planned for 1 May in Oxford. I invited Genesis P-Orridge (obituary, 16 March) to take part and a baby competition was proposed. I persuaded the Oxford Mail to promote the contest but only two mothers and their babies appeared. Graciously, Genesis awarded equal first prizes. It was the perfect antidote to all that maypole dancing.
