Most travel from the European Union to the US will be banned for 30 days, from Friday, to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Donald Trump announced that US citizens and travellers from the UK will not be affected by the suspension. Those who have visited any of the 26 countries in the Schengen area during the last 14 days prior to their planned travel to the US, will not be allowed to enter. We want to hear from those who are affected. Have you had to change your plans or make alternative arrangements? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.
