In his article “The failure of the centre-right could rot the EU from within” (Journal, 3 March), Prof Jan-Werner Müller unashamedly blames Hungary and Poland for the inability of Europe’s mainstream parties to meet voter demands and develop effective policies on an array of pressing issues. He says “mainstream conservatives have capitulated to the authoritarianism of the far right”, when, in fact, it was Europe’s centre-right that voluntarily abandoned its traditional, Christian democratic values and adopted an increasingly left-liberal view on topics that matter to the voters. Contrary to what the author suggests, political parties don’t become popular overnight and without reason. If one party wins more votes, that’s generally an indication of popular support for what that party stands for. Could it be the case, I wonder, that the recent decline of Europe’s so-called mainstream conservatives is, therefore, a sign that voters don’t like their drift towards European leftists and greens? Could it be the case that voters are looking for a genuine alternative to the ideas of the liberal left, a return to fundamental values shaped by Christian democratic ideas? Europe’s recent elections clearly point in this direction. Müller forgets that all those he calls out for “authoritarianism” have been democratically elected into office. And they were for good reason: in contrast to the European centre-right mainstream, these parties listen to the people, stand up for them and follow a clear policy direction.Zoltán KovácsState secretary for international communication and spokesperson of the Hungarian government • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
