A man in New Zealand confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus was revealed on Friday to have attended a rock concert packed with thousands of other people. Health authorities said the man in his 30s, who is the partner of a woman who was confirmed to have Covid-19 this week, attended the Tool concert at Spark Arena in Auckland on 28 February. The band played two concerts to capacity crowds in New Zealand’s largest city last week. “He was in the general admission standing area in the front left-hand quadrant,” Dr Ashley Bloomfield, ministry of health director-general of health, said at a news conference. “We encourage people who were in the general admission standing area to be aware of symptoms of Covid-19.” Bloomfield said the risk was low for all others who attended the concert. The man has been isolated at home since Wednesday. The man and his partner had recently arrived back in the country from northern Italy. New Zealand so far has four confirmed cases of the virus, a much smaller number than Australia, where 60 cases have been recorded and two elderly people have died of complications from the virus. New Zealand has extended its travel restrictions for people arriving from China and Iran in an effort to contain the outbreak of the virus.
