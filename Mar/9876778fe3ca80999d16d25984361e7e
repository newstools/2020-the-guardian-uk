This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Today, our questions are set by the Ashmolean Museum. The Ashmolean is the University of Oxford’s museum of art and archaeology. Its world-famous collections range from Egyptian mummies to contemporary art, telling human stories across cultures and time. You can see art from the Ashmolean Museum on Art UK here.
