The AFL season will suspend play for at least 30 days if any player tests positive to coronavirus, the league’s chief executive Gillon McLachlan says. “We would certainly stand down for a minimum of 30 days,” McLachlan told 3AW radio on Friday. “It is a problem that is not going away … we understand it is going to be bumpy and we all have got to stick together. We need to make sure that our protocols are completely tight.” McLachlan had previously said a positive test to a player would result in a 14-day closure of the competition. He said no players had yet tested positive to the coronavirus. “I know we have got players in quarantine,” he said. “I know there are no players or officials from tonight’s game that are pending tests.” The AFL has reduced its season from 23 rounds to 17 and started round one on schedule, with Richmond beating Carlton on Thursday night in front of no fans at the MCG. The league is anticipating suspension of play at some stage this season and is prepared for the finals to go beyond the traditional month of September. “It’s just different,” McLachlan said of games without fans. “Who knows how long we go for but I think people will get used to that ... it was just great to see footy. “Everyone is in such a terrible spot at the moment ... (if) we get around the TV sets and get lost in it, hopefully for a few hours forget about the fact that people are losing jobs and people are crook and everything else. “It’s not the only reason, clearly there’s others ... we’re a game but not the main game.” McLachlan also said players were unlikely to share water bottles, starting with Friday night’s game between Western Bulldogs and Collingwood, as they did during Thursday night’s opener. “The first game, I think you will forgive everyone for being a bit habitual,” he said. “We will get the protocols better and I think you will see changes tonight.”
