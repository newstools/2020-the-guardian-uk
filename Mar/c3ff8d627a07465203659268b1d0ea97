We’d like to hear from people who’re taking part in community action to help others during the coronavirus outbreak. As Covid-19 spreads around the world it’s easy to get swept up in a sense of fear as multiple images of cleared supermarket shelves go viral. However many groups of volunteers are coming together to lend a helping hand to those in need. Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK is coordinating a network of scores of groups across the country to offer support for those in self-isolation, as well as phone calls and WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Now we’d like to hear about your other initiatives. If you’re taking part in or setting up a grassroots community group or project to help others during the coronavirus outbreak, we’d like to hear from you. If you’re doing something on your own, let us know about that too. Your can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists may be in contact for more information.
