Zara Steiner will certainly be remembered “with great affection” by her female students. She was also an encouraging, engaging and exacting tutor of male students. While at Queens’ College, Cambridge, in the early 1970s, I was supervised by her for the American history paper, not her specialist subject but one to which she brought great knowledge and all her analytical acumen. It was worth the cycle ride to New Hall, and I too remember her with great affection.
