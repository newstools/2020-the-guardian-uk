The music festival season continues to collapse amid the coronavirus crisis, with Manchester’s Parklife as well as London’s All Points East and Lovebox festivals all now cancelled. In a statement, All Points East organisers said: “Alongside the now enforced period of social isolation, the government has stated that emergency services will not be able to support major events. Furthermore, the projected strain that is being placed on the NHS will push this institution and its staff to levels never seen before. It is therefore inconceivable for us to add any distraction to these organisations.” All three festivals offered apologies to ticket holders and refunds. Lovebox and Parklife are also allowing tickets to be carried over to the 2021 events. The cancellations come a day after the UK’s biggest rock festival, Download, cancelled hours after the 70,000-capacity Isle of Wight festival. Glastonbury and the Great Escape are among the other major UK festivals to have already cancelled. The upscale Henley festival has also announced today that it will reschedule its entire 2020 lineup for July 2021.
