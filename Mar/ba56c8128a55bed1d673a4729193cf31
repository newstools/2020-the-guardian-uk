The Bundesliga saw further protests against Hoffenheim investor Dietmar Hopp on Sunday, twice prompting the referee to stop play during Wolfsburg and Union Berlinâ€™s 2-2 draw. Offensive banners insulting Hopp were unveiled by Union Berlin fans just before half-time prompting the referee to stop the game and order the players back into the dressing rooms. Unionâ€™s players went over to the home tribune to plead with fans to take down the banners, with captain Christopher Trimmel seen in direct conversation to one of the ultras in a bid to get the game re-started. A later protest against the Deutscher FuÃŸball-Bundâ€™s (DFB) position on collective punishments and a perceived â€˜currying of favourâ€™ with Hopp saw the game stopped again as fans were warned that another indiscretion would lead to match being called off. The incidents occurred after similar scenes at Hoffenheimâ€™s Rhein-Neckar-Arena during Bayern Munichâ€™s 6-0 win on Saturday. There Bayern players and executives also tried to intervene to get banners insulting Hoop taken down as the game was held up for 20 minutes. Hopp has been a lightning rod for some German fans, who oppose the way he used his wealth to help Hoffenheim climb through the lower leagues to the Bundesliga with consecutive promotions more than a decade ago.

Strikes either side of the break from Sebastian Andersson and then Marvin Friedrich had put the hosts in full control and seemingly en route to victory. But Wolfsburg turned the tide when Friedrich Gerhardt pulled one back for Wolfsburg on the hour, heading home from a corner, before Wout Weghorst levelled the contest in the 82nd minute. Elsewhere in the Bundesliga, RB Leipzig and Bayer Levekusen also played out a draw. Leon Bailey put the visitors ahead in the 29th minute but the lead lasted little over 180 seconds as Patrik Schick headed home an equaliser to see game finish 1-1. In Italy, fans at Lecceâ€™s Via del Mare Stadium were checked by health officials as they entered the ground as part of national efforts to control the spread of coronavirus. Once inside home fans were subject to a further test of their patience as visitors Atalanta ran up a 7-2 victory. Giulio Donatiâ€™s own goal put Gian Piero Gasperiniâ€™s high-flyers ahead in the 17th minute, with DuvÃ¡n Zapata doubling Atalantaâ€™s advantage five minutes later. Lecce actually went into the break level as Riccardo Saponara and Giulio Donati ensured the score at half-time was 2-2. In the second half Josip Ilicic quickly had Atalanta ahead again before Zapata completed his hat-trick with goals in the 54th and 62nd minute. Luis Muriel and Ruslan Malinovskyi both scored late on to complete the rout and strengthen Atalantaâ€™s foothold in Serie Aâ€™s Champions League spots. Roma saw off a late push from Cagliari to win 4-3 at the Sardegna Arena. JoÃ£o Pedro gave the home side the lead just before the half hour mark but Nikola KaliniÄ‡ equalised little more than a minute later. The Croatian put his team ahead before the break with Justin Kluivert extending the advantage in the 64th minute. GastÃ³n Pereiro would briefly cut the deficit but Henrikh Mkhitaryan quickly restored two-goal Romaâ€™s cushion. JoÃ£o Pedro made the final few minutes interesting with a late strike but Roma held on to stay in touch with the teamâ€™s above them. In La Liga, a RaÃºl GarcÃ­aâ€™s penalty was enough for Athletic Bilbao to beat Villarreal at San MamÃ©s. Elsewhere, AtlÃ©tico Madridâ€™s faint hopes of a title challenge were dealt a further blow as they only managed a 1-1 draw at Espanyol. Stefan Savic put through his own net to gift the home side the lead in the first half before SaÃºl Ã‘Ã­guez equalised for AtlÃ©ti just after the break. That result meant that Getafe would go up to fourth if they could win at Mallorca. Which, thanks to Nemanja MaksimoviÄ‡ goal, the away side duly did. To add to Vicente Morenoâ€™s frustrations Salva Sevilla saw red late on for complaining to the referee. Lille are up fourth in Ligue 1 after Benjamin AndrÃ©â€™s lone effort was enough to give his side all three points at Nantes. The mid-table clash between Nice and Bordeaux ended all square, at 1-1.
