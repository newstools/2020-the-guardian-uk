I have been married for 11 years while having another relationship with a younger woman for the past five years. I love her and I love my wife. The whole drama has come out and my wife’s four children all now hate me intensely. They are all grown up and no longer live with us. My wife and I are trying to build a new relationship. However, her children don’t want to see me so we can’t stay with them or invite them over if I’m here. Is there any way forward, or is it doomed? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
