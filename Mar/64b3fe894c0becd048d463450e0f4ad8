Hot on the heels of a report by the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange arguing that “universities have lost the trust of the nation” comes research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that says “One in five students would be financially better off if they skipped higher education” (Report, 29 February). Putting aside the IFS’s focus – and that of your article – on the fact that one-fifth of students don’t benefit financially from earning a degree, rather than on the fact that four-fifths of students do benefit, the story taps into a narrow, instrumentalist view of the “value” of higher education that equates it not with personal development but solely with financial benefit. Quite why the research is described as “groundbreaking” is never made clear, but it will certainly have been warmly greeted by a government that is determined to further implant an overwhelmingly economistic logic in the higher education system in coming funding reforms. The article will have been received with despair on the picket lines of the 74 universities whose staff are in the middle of sustained strike action to defend both working and learning conditions. The imposition of a higher education “market” has fostered instability across the sector with resulting redundancies and cuts in provision, such as the decision by Sunderland University to close its history, languages and politics degrees. A university education is a public good and not a plaything for the exchequer.Prof Des FreedmanGoldsmiths, University of London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
