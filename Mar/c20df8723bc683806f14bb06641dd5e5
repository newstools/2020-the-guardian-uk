Cornershop are reminiscent of Primal Scream – well-read, politically informed survivors of indie rock, who came to national attention with a well-chosen remix, and are still happy to try any number of musical styles to please themselves as much as their audience. Both acts carry a torch for the eternal pleasure of putting a song on and feeling something, and for that, almost anything can be forgiven. Seventies glam, stoner rock and 60s psych are constants, but Cornershop wander away from more familiar paths in intriguing directions, always with an endearingly ramshackle feel that belies the cleverness of their arrangements. The bracingly titled Everywhere That Wog Army Roam could be a 70s cricket team terrace chant, with its annoyingly catchy chorus. Tjinder Singh’s underwater vocal floats nicely over Slingshot’s flute-driven folky chug, and the violin coda to Highly Amplified is a pure joy. It’s never as transcendent as 1997’s When I Was Born For The 7th Time, but when Tjinder exhorts “amplifier to the echo chamber… mixer to the microphone” on St Marie Under Canon it doesn’t sound like a tired old rocker glumly gazing round the studio for ideas, it sounds like liberation, celebration.
