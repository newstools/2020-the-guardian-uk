Government advice, announced by the prime minister on Monday, that people should stay at home is being followed inconsistently and, with warmer weather and longer days, compliance is likely to become less good. You report on the police endeavouring to deal with 20 people at a barbecue (Police leaders say enforcing UK lockdown may be impossible, 24 March). We should abandon British summer time, which is due to start this weekend. Not putting the clocks forward would send a clear signal that this year things are not normal and would help to avert the change in behaviour, and increased social contact, that summer time usually heralds.Dr Clare SlaterHethersett, Norwich • Given that the clocks change this weekend, wouldn’t it be a good idea not to change the hour and leave things as they are? This would have the effect of darkness falling at about 6pm instead of 7pm, thus not over-encouraging civil movement. It may be a bit late, but just a thought, and another way to potentially save lives, however small.Peter HullHitchin, Hertfordshire
