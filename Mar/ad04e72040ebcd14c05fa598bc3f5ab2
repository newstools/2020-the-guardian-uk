News that the Glastonbury festival 2020 has been cancelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus will have come as a shock to many. The festival’s 50th anniversary was set to take place this June, but organisers have decided to implement a fallow year and postpone until 2021. The festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis wrote on social media that a cancellation was the “only viable option” in light of the pandemic. We’d like to hear from readers who are affected by the cancellation. Were you planning to attend, perhaps for the first time, or the last time? Were you scheduled to work at Glastonbury?
