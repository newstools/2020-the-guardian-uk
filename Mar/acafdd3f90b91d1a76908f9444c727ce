To the dismay of jumps fans, the feature race on this pre-Cheltenham Saturday is a Listed all-weather contest, the Imperial Cup card at Sandown having been abandoned. Wolverhampton’s Wulfruna Stakes will now be the best race shown on ITV. At least it may fall to an ex-jump jockey in David O’Meara, trainer of Gulliver (2.45). This six-year-old wouldn’t be up to winning every Listed race but this does not look strong and he’s been in fine form of late, turning in a career best at Southwell and running to a high level in Qatar. He is preferred to Urban Icon, who is a short price for a horse that has never raced on the all-weather and hasn’t been seen since July. 1.35 Wolverhampton Fox Power is no less than 9lb better off with Via Serendipity for the half-length that separated them here a month ago, so it’s very tempting to just pick the grey to turn it around. But he hasn’t been finishing his races strongly and is a risk in a big-field handicap at a short price. Via Serendipity, on the other hand, has an attractive run-style for such a race and won over 13 rivals the last time he ran in an all-weather handicap. 1.55 Ayr Let’s get into the spirit of Cheltenham by siding with an interesting Irish raider. Drumconnor Lad, a social runner when falling in the Kim Muir last year, has no secrets from the handicapper but is a fair force at a modest level. He won at Leopardstown over Christmas and should be ready to run to form once more. 2.10 Wolverhampton The risk with Treacherous is that his last four wins have come at Kempton, so this switch to a different surface and a different configuration may be a problem. But he also ran to a high level when scoring at Newcastle early last year and is clearly the progressive one in this field, making him hard to oppose. 2.30 Ayr It was mission impossible for Jessiemac when she was asked to take on Teescomponentstrig last time but no other horse has beaten her since summer and she hasn’t been raised for that second place. 3.05 Ayr The Dutchman is one to be wary of on this return from a long absence but The Con Man is the one with the current form. Donald McCain’s runner was in a stronger race when fifth at Ascot last time and can pick up this prize. Whoshotthesheriff is talented but has had a tough season and may be in need of a break.
