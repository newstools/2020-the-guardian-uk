Bafta has announced the nominations for the 2020 games awards, and two titles have received the highest ever number of nominations in the history of the event. Hideo Kojima’s elegiac adventure Death Stranding and Remedy Entertainment’s science-fiction thriller Control have each received 11 nominations. It is a strong year for original productions. Other heavily nominated titles include the quirky detective role-playing game Disco Elysium, nostalgic Goonies-inspired adventure Knights and Bikes, and last year’s cult hit Untitled Goose Game. The best game category features only one sequel, Luigi’s Mansion 3. Other games nominated in the category are Control, Untitled Goose Game, Disco Elysium, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Outer Wilds. This year’s ceremony is introducing four new categories: animation, technical achievement, performer in a leading role and performer in a supporting role, the latter two splitting the usual performer award into two, perhaps recognising the growing role of actors in an era of highly detailed motion-captured performances. Kojima will receive the Bafta fellowship, following creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto, Will Wright and John Carmack. A woman is yet to receive fellowship recognition in video games since the awards began in 2007. The awards ceremony will take place on 2 April at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London with long-time host Dara Ó Briain returning.
