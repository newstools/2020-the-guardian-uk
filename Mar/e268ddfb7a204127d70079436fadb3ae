Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of coronavirus cases around the world has tipped over the 200,000 mark, according to the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. Iran reported its single biggest jump in deaths from the new coronavirus on Wednesday, saying that a further 147 had died in a nearly 15% increase that raises the death toll to 1,135 people nationwide. So far, 17,361 people having been infected nationwide. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended his government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, after facing widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country. In a speech to his cabinet, Rouhani said the government was “straightforward” with the nation, saying it announced the outbreak as soon as it learned about it on 19 February. “We spoke to people in a honest way. We had no delay,” he added. The Iranian government finally closed religious sites and mosques this week after weeks of criticism. “It was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it,” Rouhani said. It comes as a report from Iran’s Sharif University states that if Iranians did not cooperate with government guidelines the outbreak is likely to peak in June and cause 3.5 million deaths. Belgium is the latest country to go into lockdown, with citizens asked to stay at home and limit contact to their closest family.

Two UN agencies have announced refugees will no longer be resettled to homes in safe countries, as the world battles the Covid-19 crisis. In a joint statement, the UN refugee agency (the UNHCR) and the UN migration agency (the IOM), said refugee resettlement would be suspended as “a temporary measure that will be in place only for as long as it remains essential”. As more countries have introduced travel restrictions and frozen refugee resettlement programmes, the two agencies had little choice. They also raised concern that international travel could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus.
