Wales and Scotland have prepared as normal this week for Saturday’s match at the Principality Stadium, which is scheduled to go ahead despite the government stepping up its response to the spread of the coronavirus in the UK. It is the only one of the three matches on the final day that has not been called off, with the respective governments in Italy and France ordering the matches against England and Ireland not to go ahead as part of a policy to limit the size of crowd gatherings.

Pivac, who like his Scotland counterpart, Gregor Townsend, has made three changes for the match, was asked if he felt comfortable about 75,000 fans being in Cardiff, packing public transport and bars. “I have a huge responsibility to make sure the team is functioning as well as it can,” he said. “There are people who make those decisions and we will follow whichever way they go. That is just the way it is.” 1 Feb Wales 42-0 Italy1 Feb Ireland 19-12 Scotland2 Feb France 24-17 England 8 Feb Ireland 24-14 Wales8 Feb Scotland 6-13 England9 Feb France 35-22 Italy 22 Feb Italy 0-17 Scotland22 Feb Wales 23-27 France23 Feb England 24-12 Ireland 7 Mar Ireland v Italy (postponed)7 Mar England 33-30 Wales8 Mar Scotland 28-17 France 14 Mar Wales v Scotland (2.15pm)14 Mar Italy v England (postponed)14 Mar France v Ireland (postponed) • All times GMT; all matches on BBC or ITV Townsend, whose team are looking for a third successive victory in a Six Nations campaign for the first time, said he hoped the match went ahead, adding: “We understand that if that is not the case, it is for serious reasons. I do understand things move fast, but we are two days away and it would be a surprise if the game were called off this late.” Wales are on a run of three successive defeats but two of the changes they made were enforced, with the uncapped Sale prop WillGriff John replacing the injured Dillon Lewis and the fit-again Cory Hill coming in for Jake Ball, who needs surgery after Twickenham. Rhys Webb replaces Tomos Williams, the third scrum-half to start for Wales in as many matches. Alun Wyn Jones, the captain, will equal Richie McCaw’s record of 148 international caps. Scotland’s changes all come at forward, with Stuart McInally, Sam Skinner and Magnus Bradbury recalled. “I would have thought we are the underdogs as we have not won in Cardiff for some time [18 years] and they are above us in the rankings,” said Townsend. “We will be up against a team desperate to do well and it will be our biggest challenge of the year.”
