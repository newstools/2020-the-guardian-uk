My wife and I are foster carers and need to provide receipts for any clothes we purchase. We went into River Island in Peterborough but the sales assistant refused to give us a paper receipt. My wife did give her email, but nothing has been received, so if there is a problem we have no proof of purchase. Can I insist on a paper receipt? MD, Spalding, Lincs Retailers have gradually been cutting back on the billions of paper receipts handed out every year, partly because a large proportion can’t be recycled; they are printed “thermal paper” and coated with a potentially toxic substance called bisphenol A (or a substitute, BPS). Yet, surprisingly, there is no legal obligation for businesses or retailers to provide a receipt. Equally, there is no obligation to provide one if returning a product. What is needed is proof of purchase – a credit card statement should be fine and, if an own brand, proof of where bought. The rapid growth of contactless also means many retailers don’t offer a receipt. The short answer is that you have the right to ask for a paper receipt, but the retailer has no legal obligation to hand you one. River Island says its stores are encouraged to offer e-receipts “and tell customers of the benefits which include reducing our carbon footprint, less chance of misplacing it and making it easily accessible at all times”. But it adds: “A paper receipt can be provided at the time of purchase. And, if a customer doesn’t receive an email, customer services will be able to assist.” Your receipt has now been traced and you will be contacted to ensure you have everything you need.
