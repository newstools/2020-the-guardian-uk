You are dropped in the middle of Mexico City, ready to race 25,000km across Latin America. You are not allowed to use a plane and your phone – full of navigational apps – has been confiscated. With limited cash, you use the cheapest and most uncomfortable forms of transport imaginable. Not only are you unfamiliar with the race’s destination – Ushuaia, at the bottom of Argentina – but also you are relying on directions from members of the public, who speak a language – or languages – you don’t. This is the scenario in which the contestants find themselves at the start of the second series of Race Across the World. The first series of the BBC Two show – a sleeper hit buried in the weekend schedules – challenged teams to race between London and Singapore, mixing leisurely escapism with anxiety-inducing endurance. We can expect further emotional peaks and troughs in the second outing. If you think the contestants must have found the experience exhausting, consider the crew. Each team of two was accompanied for the entire race by two members of the production crew, who stayed at each hostel and travelled alongside them on every mode of transport. “We did a 28-hour bus, then had an hour in a bus station, then went straight on to a 21-hour bus,” says Charlotte Jacobs, an assistant producer. “Three weeks into it, a 12-hour bus journey seemed quite short. It’s amazing how much you can do on no sleep.” For the crew, overnight journeys also meant alarms blaring out several hours into their sleep, to remind them to change and recharge their camera batteries so that they could film the next day’s action. The crew were not allowed to interfere with or influence the team’s routes, either – even if they were making a mistake, which they often did. One team did not realise that they had also crossed a time zone and nearly missed a vital connection. In the first episode, two contestants took the wrong bus when leaving the Mayan ruins at Palenque in Chiapas state, southern Mexico, and almost ended up on a six-hour detour. The production team stresses that safety was a priority – a local fixer and a security adviser followed each team, but kept enough distance to make the trip felt authentic. However, filming in Latin America posed a unique set of challenges. Venezuela was out of bounds before the race even began, due to the political and economic crisis in the country. Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador all declared states of emergency whilst the race was in progress. Teams still visited the countries, but were rerouted to avoid certain parts of each. Riots in Bolivia, following a contentious presidential election, resulted in all the teams being forced to leave the country by a certain date. Cameras were stolen from crew members, while two contestants lost a pouch containing a significant amount of their budget. These crises also had knock-on effects on the various checkpoints that each team had to pass. Five out of the seven checkpoints had to be relocated – checkpoints that were long arranged and located at suitable hotels, to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. The contestants were already on their way to the first location when a change was forced upon them. “That was pretty hard, but I think it ended up being one of the most exciting checkpoints of the series. And certainly one of the more peaceful,” says the series producer, Lucy Curtis. “We joke that whenever things are going smoothly we get a bit bored!” To ensure that the race was feasible in the first place, two members of the production team completed the whole journey in advance of filming. The recce (which was also undertaken for the first series) was even more arduous than the race itself, as there were only two people – only one of whom knew where they were supposed to be going. “The other person has no idea and that person is in charge of making the decisions,” explains Curtis. On the recces, the team had constant nightmares with money. Foreign exchanges were few and far between, because locals tended to use bank cards. “We want to test how long it would take if you were someone who goes into it blind. They are a bit stir crazy at times, stuck on boats and buses and trains for days on end, but it’s an amazing job.” Indeed, for all of the stresses, racing across the world always proves to be a joyful experience. It has transformative effects on the contestants, all of whom are at a crossroads in their lives or are trying to get closer to their teammate. It is life-affirming for those who travel with them, too. Jacobs has put herself forward to accompany another team for a further series, still high from the last experience. “Now I’m thinking about it, I’m like: ‘Oh no!’” she says, laughing. “What have I let myself in for?” Race Across The World returns tonight, 8pm, BBC Two
