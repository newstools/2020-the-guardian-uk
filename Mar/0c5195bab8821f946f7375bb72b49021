Darley Park lies just north of Derby city centre, sloping down to the River Derwent. Trees line the river, and are dotted around the park – beech, oak and chestnut predominate. It’s often busy with dog walkers, joggers and families, but it’s big enough to offer some peace and escape from the city. I have been walking my dogs here for more than 20 years, and must have passed this particular oak hundreds of times without really noticing it. One day, I looked at it and saw this face looking back at me. Maybe the light was different on this day or I was more attuned to seeing it. Now I give it (him/her?) a nod when I pass, and I’ve seen others doing the same. There are plenty of more beautiful trees in the park, but I’m particularly fond of this one – it makes me smile. • Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in the form
