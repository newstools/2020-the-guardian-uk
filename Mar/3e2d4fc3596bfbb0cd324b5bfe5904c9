Three men have been arrested after police found a van full of stolen toilet roll and handwash. Officers were alerted by a report of suspicious activity in the Essex town of Hatfield Peverel at 10.20pm on Friday. It was alleged that a van was driven through a barrier at a building site in Bury Lane. When police pulled over a vehicle on the A13 in South Ockendon half an hour later, they found dozens of packets of toilet paper, among other items. A 28-year-old man from Averley, a 37-year-old from South Ockendon and a 41-year-old from Purfleet remain in custody on suspicion of theft of vehicle and burglary. Essex police tweeted: “Police officers always get a massive sense of satisfaction when we catch burglars … however, we never expected to find this stolen loot in the boot.” Police officers always get a massive sense of satisfaction when we catch burglars... however we never expected to find this stolen loot in the boot. 🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻🧻Stolen items recovered and 3 arrested all within an hour of it being reported 👍🏻 #ThatsHowWeRoll 🧻 pic.twitter.com/zeqY9CNEbN
