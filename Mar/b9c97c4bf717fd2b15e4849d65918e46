I have lived near this oak for 19 years and see it nearly every day while walking my dogs. This photograph reminds me of one misty morning in December 2018 with my westies Pepper and Arnie. Pepper has since passed away. But while I have special memories of this tree, I am not alone. Everyone who visits Cwm George and Casehill Woods, or Dinas Powys Woods as the locals call them, will recognise it. That is more than 50,000 people every year. After surviving for more than two centuries, the tree is now at risk from proposals to build a dam, which would cause the valley in which it stands to flood several times a year. The oak would slowly die – as would many other ancient trees. A year ago, some of us set up a campaign to protect the woods. Naturally, we chose this tree as the basis of our logo. • Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in the form here.
