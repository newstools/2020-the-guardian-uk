Mulan, Disney’s most expensive live-action remake to date, has been officially pulled from release schedules. Due to open in the US and UK on 27 March, the film, which is directed by Niki Caro on a $200m (£155m) budget, is currently awaiting a new date. Release in China – one of the key target markets for the film – has already been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New Mutants is a superhero adventure acquired by Disney as part of last year’s buyout of Fox; this will be its fifth big-screen delay after a series of events saw the original 2018 date slip. Antlers is a sci-fi horror produced by Guillermo del Toro and starring Jesse Plemons. The studio has so far declined to shift the worldwide 1 May release for Black Widow, the Avengers spin-off starring Scarlett Johansson, but its postponement is anticipated. The advantage of retaining the original release date would be lack of competition, with Universal’s Trolls World Tour the only mainstream title still planned to open at that time. But if cinemas close before then, or public appetite is gauged to be so low for a protracted trip out to an unventilated space in close proximity with strangers, Disney will have little choice. On Thursday, Universal pushed the release of Fast 9 back a year to spring 2021, while Paramount put release plans for A Quiet Place 2 on hold. The release of the James Bond movie No Time to Die was moved from April to November earlier this month.
