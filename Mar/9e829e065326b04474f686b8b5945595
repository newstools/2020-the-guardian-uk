A day after postponing the Tokyo Olympics the IOC president, Thomas Bach, invoked comments by Donald Trump to defend himself from criticism. Bach spoke to about 400 reporters on a Wednesday conference call and was asked why, despite growing concern from athletes, it took so long to postpone the Tokyo Games. He noted that many governments have imposed social limits only into next month and pointed to Trump’s hope of easing restrictions by mid-April. “In the last couple of weeks the measures of many governments, they were limited until middle of April, some beginning of May,” Bach said. “You have maybe seen the latest declarations there in the United States from President Trump about the prospect of middle of April there being able to lift many restrictions.” Bach and the IOC faced mounting criticism last week from athletes, including Olympic gold medalists, for saying the Tokyo Olympics would start as scheduled in late July. The Canadian Olympic committee said before the decision it would not send a team to Tokyo this summer. Even Trump said on 12 March that the Olympics should be postponed for a year. The IOC board’s eventual decision on Tuesday, with Japanese government agreement, to delay until 2021 came a day after the World Health Organization said the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating. Bach was also asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he had thought of resigning because of the athletes’ criticism. “No,” he replied. The postponement calls for the Tokyo Games to take place no later than the summer of 2021.
