Canadian rapper Drake now has more US chart hits than any other artist in history, scoring his 208th Billboard Hot 100 entry this week. The rapper broke the record, previously set by the cast of the TV show Glee, with the track Oprah’s Bank Account by Lil Yachty and DaBaby, which he guests on. It reached No 85 off the back of 10.5m streams. He is also at No 3 in the chart with Life Is Good, a track with Future, and at No 46 on Chris Brown’s song No Guidance. With a cross-generational, cross-demographic appeal thanks to a blend of rap, pop and R&B, Drake has become the world’s top rapper. Spotify named him the most streamed artist of the last decade, with 28bn global streams. His first US chart entry was Best I Ever Had, which debuted at No 92 in May 2009, eventually rising to No 2. His 207 chart placements since have been bulked out by frequent guest spots on tracks by artists including Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Travis Scott, as well as his solo hits. He has scored seven US No 1 singles, while all five of his studio albums and three of his mixtapes have reached No 1 on the US album chart.
