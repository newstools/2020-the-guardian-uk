Fleabag stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott are in the running for acting prizes at this year’s Olivier awards. The nominations, which were announced on Tuesday, include best actress for Waller-Bridge for reprising the role in her Fleabag monologue in a sold-out season in the West End and best actor for Scott for his performance as a washed-up matinee idol in Noël Coward’s Present Laughter at the Old Vic. Waller-Bridge received a second nomination for Fleabag, which will compete for the award for best entertainment or comedy play. Fleabag was nominated for an Olivier award in 2014 when it was staged at Soho theatre after an Edinburgh fringe run, years before it became a hit TV series. The show leading this year’s Olivier nominations, with a tally of nine, is the bright and bold jukebox musical & Juliet, which features hit songs produced by the Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin and imagines an alternative ending to Shakespeare’s tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The musical received three acting nominations (for David Bedella, Cassidy Janson and Miriam-Teak Lee) as well as nominations for best new musical, best original score or new orchestrations, best theatre choreographer and best lighting, set and costume designs. & Juliet won six prizes at the WhatsOnStage awards on Sunday. For the Olivier award for best new musical it is up against an adaptation of the French film Amélie and two hit American shows, Waitress and Dear Evan Hansen. The best actor in a musical category features two young performers in their West End debuts: Sam Tutty as the troubled teenager Evan Hansen and Jac Yarrow in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Charlie Stemp is nominated for Mary Poppins and so is Andy Nyman for Fiddler on the Roof, which picked up eight nominations including one for Trevor Nunn as best director and one for Judy Kuhn as best actress in a musical. In that category, Kuhn and Miriam Teak-Lee are up against Audrey Brisson for Amélie and Zizi Strallen for Mary Poppins. Dear Evan Hansen has seven nominations in total, with four of its cast recognised in the best supporting role categories. Revivals of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman and Henrik Ibsen’s Rosmersholm picked up five nominations each, including best actor for Wendell Pierce as Miller’s Willy Loman and best actress for Sharon D Clarke who plays his wife, Linda. Hayley Atwell (Rosmersholm) and Juliet Stevenson (The Doctor) are also nominated for best actress and Toby Jones (Uncle Vanya) and James McAvoy (Cyrano de Bergerac) are in the running for best actor. The best director award – now given in honour of Sir Peter Hall after his name was omitted from the “in memoriam” segment in 2018 – is between Jamie Lloyd for Cyrano de Bergerac, Trevor Nunn for Fiddler on the Roof, Ian Rickson for Uncle Vanya, and Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell who co-directed Death of a Salesman. The best new play category features The Ocean at the End of the Lane, A Very Expensive Poison, The Doctor and Leopoldstadt, which Tom Stoppard has said could be his final play. In the technical categories, the brothers Ben and Max Ringham are nominated for their sound designs for both at the National Theatre and Cyrano de Bergerac at the Playhouse. For best set design, Rae Smith will see if her design for Rosmersholm will beat her set for Uncle Vanya, or if both will lose out to either Bob Crowley for Mary Poppins or Soutra Gilmour for & Juliet. The awards ceremony is on 5 April at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and will be osted by Jason Manford.
