Andy Gill and Gang of Four weren’t just students in Leeds, they were part of the cultural infrastructure of the city. They were part of the musical scene centred on the Fenton pub, and slums like the one I lived in, in Harehills. When the Rock Against Racism club started in Leeds in 1978, their politics made us natural allies. They played tours, carnivals and campaigns for us; they played on the back of trucks on demos and on stages in front of thousands, they wore the badges and the T-shirts. They also featured on the RAR’s Greatest Hits LP in 1980.
