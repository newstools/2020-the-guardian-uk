England bowler Jofra Archer has condemned racial abuse on social media after posting racist messages he has received. The 24-year-old, who helped England win the 2019 World Cup, took screenshots of messages from an individual and posted them on his Instagram story on Monday evening. He commented below the messages saying: “I [have] given a lot of thought about reacting to this and I hope that no one else has to deal with stuff like this on a regular basis, it isn’t ever acceptable and should be addressed properly in my opinion. “I will never understand how people feel so freely to say these things to another human being, it baffles me.” It is the not the first time that Archer has spoken out on the subject. He was racially abused at the end of the first Test against New Zealand last November after he scored a second-innings 30 during England’s defeat in Mount Maunganui. Archer, who received the abuse as he walked back to the pavilion at the Bay Oval, tweeted after the match: “A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today while battling to help save my team. The crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy.” New Zealand Cricket announced in January that a 28-year-old man, who admitted the offence, had been banned from attending international and domestic games in the country for two years. The fast bowler has been recovering from a stress fracture in his elbow, diagnosed after England’s tour of South Africa. Archer said on 5 March he was “making good progress” and recently extended his contract with Sussex until 2022,
