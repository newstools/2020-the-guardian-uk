Jersey Bulls say they will make their case to the Football Association after being denied promotion to the Combined Counties Premier Division. The newly-formed non-league side won all 27 of their Division One matches and mathematically guaranteed promotion. That has now been denied after the FA’s decision to cancel the season from step three downwards because of the coronavirus crisis. The club said in a statement: “We are of course disappointed with the recent decision of the FA to null and void the season, and discount the club’s hard work over the last eight months and our record-breaking first season. “The club was in the unusual position of having already secured promotion at the time the league was suspended and we will be engaging further with the FA and Combined Counties League on this issue. “We are extremely proud of the wonderful efforts and achievements of all our players, management team and club members,” the statement added. “We would also like to thank all our supporters for their overwhelming support in our first season.” The statement from the Bulls chairman, Russell Le Feuvre, said the club’s thoughts “first and foremost surround the wellbeing of all our club members, players and supporters, and the wider public during these difficult times”. The FA’s decision to render the current season null and void in all leagues below the National League has been met with criticism and anger. The chairman of South Shields, who sat 12 points clear in the Northern Premier League, said his club had been “badly let down” and would consider legal action.
