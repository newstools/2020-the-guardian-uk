Tom Hanks and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, are “not great” but “feeling better every day”, according to his sister, Sandra. The couple are in self-isolation after being discharged from a Queensland hospital following almost a week’s stay. Sandra Hanks Benoiton told People: “Tom and Rita are doing very well and continue to recover. Their recovery is very much on course for healthy adults with this virus. They are feeling better each day.” Earlier this week, Hanks posted an update saying the symptoms were “much the same … no fever but the blahs. Folding the laundry and doing the dishes leads to a nap on the couch.” Idris Elba also tested positive for the disease earlier this week. On Thursday, actor Daniel Dae Kim, who is also suffering from coronavirus, took aim at the racism that has affected some people of Asian background since the outbreak, with Trump repeatedly calling it the “Chinese virus”. “Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people,” Kim said. “Randomly beating elderly, sometimes homeless, Asian Americans is cowardly, heartbreaking and inexcusable. Yes, I’m Asian, and yes I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China. I got it in America. In New York City. “And despite what some political leaders want to call it, I don’t consider the place where it’s from as important as the people who are sick and dying.”
