Finn Russell looks set to return to the Scotland squad – but not until after the Six Nations campaign. The fly-half has held positive talks with the head coach, Gregor Townsend, and will return to the fold in July when Scotland tour South Africa. It was agreed the Racing 92 playmaker would not be involved on the field in Scotland’s final two Six Nations fixtures but would instead give tactical insight with the coaching staff before France visit Murrayfield on Sunday. The 27-year-old has missed the opening Six Nations fixtures after a breach of team protocol in January. Russell was not considered for Scotland’s defeats by Ireland and England after he missed a training session following a late-night drinking session. In a subsequent newspaper interview, he then claimed he did not have a “personal relationship” with Townsend, who coached him with Glasgow and the national team. The coach hit back with his own statement: “The door will be open to any player with the required level of ability – if they commit to being a trusted member of the team.” The player and coach have have held encouraging talks and Russell is expected to line up for Scotland in July when they play two Tests in South Africa and one in New Zealand. He could win his 50th cap during the summer tour. 1 Feb Wales 42-0 Italy1 Feb Ireland 19-12 Scotland2 Feb France 24-17 England 8 Feb Ireland 24-14 Wales8 Feb Scotland 6-13 England9 Feb France 35-22 Italy 22 Feb Italy 0-17 Scotland22 Feb Wales 23-27 France23 Feb England 24-12 Ireland 7 Mar Ireland v Italy (postponed)7 Mar England v Wales (4.45pm)8 Mar Scotland v France (3pm) 14 Mar Wales v Scotland (2.15pm)14 Mar Italy v England (4.45pm)14 Mar France v Ireland (8pm) • All times GMT; all matches on BBC or ITV Meanwhile the second-row Lewis Carmichael has been added to the Scotland squad for the rest of the Six Nations. Carmichael has impressed for Edinburgh since a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament ruled him out of the 2018-19 season. The 24-year-old has won two caps, which included a try-scoring debut against Canada on the 2018 summer tour. He replaces the Worcester back-row Cornell Du Preez in the 37-man squad. The Edinburgh wing Darcy Graham has been ruled out of Scotland’s remaining Six Nations games against France and Wales with a knee injury he sustained at the start of the campaign.
