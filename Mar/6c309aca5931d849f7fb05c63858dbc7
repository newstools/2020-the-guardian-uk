In your article (The Guardian’s promise to our readers, 21 March) you say, “We will pay particular attention to what it is like to be a health worker right now: are they getting the protection and support they need? We are committed to hearing what they tell us.” I have been horrified that my GP daughter is visiting potential virus patients at home in her inner London practice without adequate protective clothing or a mask. My understanding is that repeated exposure to coronavirus worsens the dose you are likely to get. So the lack of masks does not just mean medical workers run the same risks as the rest of us, but that they will possibly get a much worse case. We need our medics to stay well, and getting suitable protective equipment to hospital workers and GPs quickly should be the government’s priority.Laura SparkesLondon • My daughter is a consultant at three London hospitals. She is working long hours and she is without protection. Staff have been promised special masks and overalls, but nothing has arrived. Despicable.Kavya HughesLondon
