Liverpool will move a nerve-shredding 25 points clear with 10 games left should they set a new English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home league wins with victory over relegation-threatened Bournemouth. Mohamed Salah is in line to make his 100th Premier League appearance for the club. He has scored 69 league goals for Jürgen Klopp’s team so far, including seven in five outings against Bournemouth, and needs one more to become the first Liverpool player since Michael Owen to score 20 goals in three successive seasons in all competitions. The visitors have lost their last five away matches.
