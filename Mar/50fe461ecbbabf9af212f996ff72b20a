We’ve been hosting actors for about three years. I am an actor and so is my husband; we were looking for a way of making a little money on the side. We let out a single room and a double, our daughter’s room, when she’s not here. A couple of weeks ago we had somebody in each room because Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was in town. If we’re making breakfast, we offer it to the guests, and we offer them a glass of wine in the evening. Mark and I worked together years ago, but we’d lost touch. He came through the Theatre Digs Booker website last year when he was doing a show in Chesterfield; it was really nice to see him again. This is the second time he’s stayed. Actors are easy to get on with. I quite like having people in the house, although some keep themselves to themselves, and actors tend to be out in the evenings. But you do get a few lost souls who need to chat. I live in London and have to pay rent there, so I need to find something cost-effective; B&Bs can be a bit pricey. I do a tour every year or so, at least. When you’re in actors’ digs, you’re not on holiday; it’s about a bed for the night and being able to make a cup of coffee. We need someone who will allow us to creep in late once the show is up, and then crash out. Susie is welcoming and friendly, and will allow you to lounge about in front of the television. I’ve stayed in some dodgy digs over the years, the kinds of places you think, “Get me out of here!” I’m always grateful to people like Susie who are happy to open up their homes to thesps like me, who wander around trying to make a living. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
