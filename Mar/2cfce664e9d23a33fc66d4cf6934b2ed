Kevin De Bruyne will undergo a late fitness test on his damaged shoulder before being made available for Sunday’s Manchester derby. The midfielder sustained the injury during City’s Carabao Cup final victory over Aston Villa. While Pep Guardiola said after Tuesday’s FA Cup win at Sheffield Wednesday that De Bruyne had hurt his back, the player actually has a shoulder problem. City believe he has a chance of facing United and will give him as long as possible to prove he can play at Old Trafford. City Football Group is exploring the possibility of making AS Nancy, of France’s Ligue 2, the ninth team under its umbrella. Jacques Rousselet, the Nancy president, confirmed the club are in talks with CFG. “I’m in talks with buyers,” he said. “The club’s sale is moving forward well and things have even accelerated and intensified with the City Football Group, who are very precise and very meticulous in their analysis of the club. We’ll see but it’s premature to announce anything.”
