Welcome to our weekly roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic, which is continuing to pose unprecedented challenges around the world. By Friday morning the outbreak had grown to more than half a million confirmed infections ‚Äì more than double the figure a week ago ‚Äì with the US, China, Italy and Spain accounting for more than half of these, according to trackers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The true number is certain to be far higher since many countries are not aiming to test all cases. Addressing world leaders at a virtual summit on Thursday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization director general, described the pandemic as ‚Äúthe defining health crisis of our time‚Äù, warning that millions of people could die without decisive action from leaders. ‚ÄúWe are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart,‚Äù he said. On Thursday the US overtook China as the country with the most cases. The US death toll surpassed 1,000, doctors at New York hospitals complained of nightmarish conditions and it was revealed that 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week ‚Äì the biggest single-week jump in history. Donald Trump put the escalation in cases down to the US doing more testing than other countries.

The country is now working to prevent imported cases. The death toll in Italy, at the centre of Europe‚Äôs outbreak, continued to rise, reaching more than 8,000 by Thursday, including 41 healthcare workers who caught the virus while working on the frontlines and an increasing number of cases sweeping through the poorer southern regions. Spain overtook Italy in recording the world‚Äôs highest single-day number of deaths, with 738 dying over 24 hours on Wednesday, prompting criticism of the government‚Äôs management of the crisis. Germany‚Äôs low mortality rate ‚Äì 0.3% compared, with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK ‚Äì offered a glimmer of hope, and the head of the country‚Äôs public health institute said on Monday there were signs that the increase in infections was levelling off for the first time owing to the strict physical distancing measures in force.
