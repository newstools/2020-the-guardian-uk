An ex-police officer in Western Australia has been charged with 108 sexual offences including 66 counts of rape. The 50-year-old man, who resigned from WA police in 2018 after he was charged by the internal affairs unit, is alleged to have sexually assaulted “a number of women” who he met through online dating sites from 2010 onward. In a statement on Thursday, WA police said the investigation into the former police officer’s conduct was ongoing. “It will be alleged between 2010 to present, the man met numerous women through various online dating applications,” a police spokeswoman said. “During a number of these dates, it is alleged the man sexually assaulted a number of women, some who are yet to come forward to police.” The man, from the Perth suburb of Kelmscott, has been charged with 34 counts of sexual penetration without consent; 32 counts of aggravated sexual penetration without consent; eight counts of aggravated indecent assault; three counts of indecent assault; and one count of committing an indecent act with intent to offend. He has been charged with eight counts of using a date rape drug; three counts of aggravated sexual coercion and one count of sexual coercion. Police also charged the man with aggravated assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault and common assault. The man was scheduled to appear in the Perth magistrates court on Thursday. Police have asked anyone with information about any sexual assault to contact police via Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000 and said callers may remain anonymous.
