It was concerning to read your story concerning MoD lobbying for reduced public notice of any UK drone testing (MoD clashed with civil regulator about drone flight warning to pilots, 10 March). The evolution of drones and the continued automation of weapons of war raise ethical and moral questions. It is a vital part of any democracy to have the right to protest. It is particularly important that issues of defence and security can be explored via public debate and challenged via, among other things, peaceful protest. After all, the purpose of any defence force is to keep the public safe, and so the public should be able to engage and interrogate the ways the state acts in its name.Richard BickleChair of trustees, The Fellowship of Reconciliation • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
