Italy has more than 9,000 confirmed cases and more than 460 people have died. The Chinese president has arrived in Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. It’s being seen as a signal that the Chinese leadership believes its fight against the epidemic is largely won. On Tuesday he’s expected to meet medical workers, soldiers, community staff, grassroots and local party officials, as well as patients and residents. Xi was notably absent from public view during the height of the outbreak, instead sending his deputy Li Keqiang to the city. On Tuesday China reported just 19 new cases of the virus (all in Hubei province), and 17 deaths (all in Wuhan). The US president has promised to alleviate concerns over the spread of the virus and its potential economic impact in the US, after a terrible day on the Dow Jones, which closed down 7.8% (London’s FSTSE100 dropped 7.7%). He said he would ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and that he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalised for something that’s not their fault”. More than 500 cases have been diagnosed in 35 states. It emerged that at least two members of Congress with whom Trump has recently been in close contact were in self-quarantine because they were in contact with a known carrier of the virus. One of the congressmen greeted Trump with a handshake at an airport on Friday. Asian markets rallied slightly on Tuesday in the wake of the US proposed economic measures. Australia’s stock market finished the day up 3%, having fallen 7.3% on Monday.

South Korea on Tuesday reported fewer than 150 new cases for the first time in two weeks. A total of 131 infections were confirmed on Monday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Three more people died, it added, taking the death toll to 54.
