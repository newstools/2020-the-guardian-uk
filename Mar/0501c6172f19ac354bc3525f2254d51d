Pep Guardiola believes it inevitable that England will follow the example of Italy and Spain and begin playing football matches behind closed doors because of coronavirus, but hopes the precaution will be limited to no more than a couple of games. “You have to ask whether it is worth playing football without the spectators,” the Manchester City manager said. “It doesn’t make any sense to play professional football without the people, because they are the ones we do it for, but obviously we are going to follow the instructions we are given. “I would prefer not to play games without people watching, but clearly health is the most important thing, not the competition. I do think playing games behind close doors is going to happen here, but just one or two games, maybe. No longer than that.” City’s next game brings the return of Mikel Arteta to the Etihad Stadium after leaving his position as Guardiola’s coaching assistant to take over as manager of Arsenal in December. The pair have been in regular contact since, and Guardiola has every confidence in his former protege succeeding in north London. “I said after one season that Mikel would make a good manager for someone, as long as the right offer came along,” Guardiola said. “He knows Arsenal very well, he played there a long time, and I’m sure they will have some success with him in charge.” Sergio Agüero should be fit for the visit of the Gunners, while Kevin de Bruyne, who has missed the last two City games with a shoulder injury, is back in training and will be subject to a later fitness assessment.

With Liverpool needing six more points to secure the title, two successive City defeats could see them crowned without kicking a ball, though of all the permutations and possibilities surrounding the eventual moment when a 30-year wait is ended, Guardiola’s team losing two home games in succession is among the more outlandish.
