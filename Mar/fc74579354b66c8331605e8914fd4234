Your interesting advertisement feature about the “12 essential Chilean food experiences you can’t miss”, produced by Guardian Labs (17 February), included the Peruvian national cocktail, the pisco sour, as one of those experiences. Some of your readers will already have had the opportunity of learning that, since colonial times, a unique and high-quality spirit made from grapes brought to America by the Spaniards has been produced in the valley and city of Pisco, which gave the spirit its name. The production of pisco in Peru is limited to specific geographic regions along the Peruvian coast, including Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and parts of Tacna, and is obtained exclusively from the distillation of fresh musts from recently fermented pisqueras grapes. The appellation of origin of pisco was registered at the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2005. The luckiest of your readers will also have had the pleasure of trying this fine and distinct spirit, which can also be used as an ingredient for pisco sour, a cocktail first created by Victor Morris, an American entrepreneur, in Lima in 1915. Your article also includes a reference to Chilean ceviche, but I would like to point out that it originally included a photo with the caption “close-up shot for a delicious traditional Peruvian ceviche in the restaurant”. Ceviche is eaten in many parts of the Pacific rim of Latin America, each with slight variations and characteristics. Lastly, I would like to invite Guardian Labs to produce, sometime soon, content on the very rich gastronomy that Peru has to offer, which I am sure will be greatly welcomed by your readers.Juan Carlos GamarraAmbassador, Embassy of Peru in the United Kingdom • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
