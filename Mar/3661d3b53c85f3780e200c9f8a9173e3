Harry Kane is on course to be fit when the Premier League resumes. The Tottenham striker has been out with a hamstring injury since New Year’s Day and says that in normal circumstances he would expect to resume training with the team in two to three weeks. There will be no matches played until 30 April at the earliest because of coronavirus and Premier League clubs are due to discuss the situation again next week. “From a rehab point of view and personal point of view, I’m doing really well,” Kane told Tottenham’s website. “I’m at a good stage now and just working hard, doing a lot of recovery, a lot of rehab and just waiting to see what happens to the season. “I’m not too far away, I’d normally hope to be back with the team in two or three weeks. I’m at a good stage, pretty much doing everything, now it’s about building up my fitness.” Reflecting on the wider picture in football and society Kane said: “It’s such a strange situation; no one has been in this situation before. Like anything, you have to take the positives out of it and do what you can. So far, me and the family are well, and I’ll continue to work hard, work in the gym, work from home and do what I can. “We’ll just have to wait and see. My family is well, and obviously everyone is thinking about coronavirus at the moment and it’s a time to be together, to stay safe and hopefully everything will be all right.”
