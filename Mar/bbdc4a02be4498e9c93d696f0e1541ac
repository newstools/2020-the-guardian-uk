The first time I saw Zoe Lyons’ bit about her wife buying her a present, I think I actually shrieked a bit because it was so on the money. She describes getting over-excited by the thought of surprises to the point that then whatever it is seems rubbish by comparison to her imagination. And it’s exactly how I behave. You’ve Been Framed. I find slapstick SO funny – that show has me crying every episode. Unless it’s a clip with a bike in. They make me feel icky. Me? Probably me. Why wouldn’t I say me? Anything less is bad publicity. Heckles aren’t funny, heckles are dumb and then I make them funny. My husband, who despises the kitchen, once cooked for me while I was recording a podcast at our house, and I came out of the room to find him sitting on the floor weeping with laughter because it had taken him two hours to make some cold broccoli, greasy potatoes and a pile of accidentally shredded halloumi. We laughed for hours. The other night I dreamt I was a cloud of bats hiding in a crazy golf course and flicking the balls back out to annoy people. Farts. They should be too silly to make a professional comedian laugh but I swear EVERY time, I find farts funny. 12 because it’s a wee and a poo. I love Milton Jones’ one-liner: “The other day I saw a dead baby ghost lying on the pavement – on second thoughts, it might have been a handkerchief.” Laura Lexx was on tour, she’s now in her living room: keep up on Twitter @lauralexx, Instagram @lexxlaura and YouTube /lauralexxcomedy
