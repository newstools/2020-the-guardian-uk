The relative safety of 12th place with 10 games to go after back-to-back wins has helped Roy Hodgson land a deal for another season at Crystal Palace, whom he joined in September 2017 when they had no points after seven games under the guidance of Frank de Boer. The rest is history as the former England manager helped extend their longest ever spell in the top flight to seven seasons. Last season’s best-ever points total of 49 is a realistic target too, if they can capitalise in front of goal. Palace have 11 goals from 14 home games, the worst in the division, while Watford, 11 away goals in 14, finally moved out of the bottom three with last week’s shock defeat of Liverpool but will have to get a result without the services of the livewire Gerard Deulofeu, who ruptured an ACL ligament in that game.
