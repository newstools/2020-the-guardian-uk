The Foreign Office (FCO) is advising UK nationals against all but essential international travel. Border closures and other travel restrictions are increasing globally. The FCO advice took effect on 17 March, for an initial period of 30 days. This article is being updated daily. It was last updated at 6.30pm (GMT), 20 March In a statement, the FCO said the advice is in response to the increasingly unpredictable situation in terms of restrictions being imposed: “Often there is little or no notice when countries take these steps and restrictions are also being imposed in areas where no cases of coronavirus have yet been reported. They are therefore very difficult to predict. “British people who decide that they still need to travel abroad should be fully aware of the increased risks of doing so. That includes the risk that they may not be able to get home, if travel restrictions are put in place. Anyone still considering travel to be realistic about the level of disruption they are willing and able to endure, and to make decisions in light of the unprecedented conditions we face.” The FCO is not advising UK nationals to immediately return to the UK, but says that people should “keep in mind that flights may be cancelled at short notice or other travel restrictions may be put in place by foreign governments” and to “take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly, while flights remain available in many places”. The following countries have travel restrictions in place that may affect UK nationals (who do not have residencies in other countries). This includes quarantine measures, border closures, flight suspensions, health screenings and other measures. Restrictions are constantly changing and we are updating as quickly as possible: * EU proposes suspension of non-essential travel The EU has proposed that all non-essential travel should be suspended to European Union for 30 days, the president of the EU commission has announced.
