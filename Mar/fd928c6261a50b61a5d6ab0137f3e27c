Grace Dent is always a good read, as her reviews pull no punches. But her piece in Feast (28 March) moved away from that, for it was so emotional. For not only the way she talked about looking after her mum, far away in Cumbria, but also the praise she gives to the supermarket staff, who we indeed should recognise for their “selfless hard work”. At the end of the item I had a lump in my throat. Plus a spectacular photo to support it. Thank you, Grace.Paul JohnsonCowes, Isle of Wight
