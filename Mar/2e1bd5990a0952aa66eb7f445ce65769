Polly Toynbee makes the point that hospitals will have to ration ventilators and therefore exclude elderly people because they are least likely to benefit (Coronavirus will force hospital chiefs to make some terrible choices, 17 March). As an almost 70-year-old retired GP, I consider that I have about a 5% chance of dying from the virus – and have a high expectation of catching it. I do not wish to die in a hospital in chaos, or use up a ventilator that could be put to better use. Nor do I wish my family to suffer a traumatic bereavement as a result of a badly managed death (as a bereavement support volunteer, I am well aware of how the circumstances of death impact on grief). I have therefore told my GP and those around me that, if I contract the virus, I do not want to go to hospital if I develop the severe form. I would prefer to be cared for at home with adequate drug control of symptoms and oxygen (unventilated) if necessary. I suspect many others would like the same. I propose that NHS England sets up a homecare service for Covid-19 and staffs it with retired GPs, district nurses and palliative care nurses, who will all have had experience in caring for sick and dying patients at home. This would give a realistic option for patients who did not want to go into hospital. It would also ease the burden on hospitals.Dr Lyn JenkinsChesham, Buckinghamshire • Perhaps the 65,000 retired doctors and nurses (£2.9bn provided to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients, 19 March) should only agree to return to the NHS if they receive a written guarantee that when this is all over, social care will continue to be funded at the “emergency” rate. This seems a not unreasonable reward for their futures if they are being asked to sacrifice themselves now.Deirdre BurrellMortimer, Berkshire
