The Fiver was never entirely confident that the professional matrimony of José Mourinho and Daniel Levy would reach its silver jubilee. But we thought it would take more than a few months for things to turn so sour. José is already wearing his third-season coupon, the permanently affronted puss of a man waiting for a P45 so that he can go off and find his true calling within the nihilism community. Whether it’s in cup competitions or in the manager’s job itself, José doesn’t hang around long these days. The Special One is dead, long live the Do One. Spurs’ 3-0 defeat to RB Leipzig in Big Cup came as no great surprise. Certainly not to José, who already knew that life is without objective meaning, purpose or intrinsic valu … sorry, who already knew that his knack-hit squad would struggle in Germany. “We have lots of problems and it’s really difficult,” he sobbed. “I was positive yesterday but that’s the way I have to be. The reality is a different thing. One team is much stronger. Of course it was difficult and Leipzig clearly deserve to get to the quarter-finals. There is no other world. Nor even this one. What, then, is there? The inner smile provoked in us by the patent nonexistence of both.” Mourinho continued to passionately defend his team. Mainly by calling them cr@p, but it’s the thought that counts: “Every team in the world would struggle with five or six of their most important players missing. It’s as simple as that. All the players on the Leipzig bench would play at this moment in my team. Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” As a tea-time email that has never been successful in anything, ever, we’re not really able to understand Mourinho’s decline from charismatic winner to entitled failure. He is still the best manager in the world – but sadly it’s expectation management, rather than football, in which he excels these days. And after the game against Leipzig, he was quick to remind Spurs fans that they shouldn’t expect these soul-crushing 4-0 aggregate defeats to come round every year. “With the squad we have at the moment it is going to be very, very difficult [to reach next season’s Big Cup],” he parped. “Our problems are not going to disappear tomorrow. We will fight until the end. Virtue is under certain circumstances merely an honourable form of stupidity: who could be ill-disposed toward it on that account?” Mourinho is still right about plenty, but he has cried wolf so often that nobody cares about that big furry thing chasing the sheep. It already feels like, at some stage next season, he will be back in the Sky studio with fellow optimists Graeme Souness and Roy Keane. For now, he has to struggle on in a world that just doesn’t understand. Spurs’ next game is at home to a resurgent Manchester United. He’s going to be in a belting mood if they lose that.

I own a football club myself and I think it’s important to give support to the manager. Stability is the key to success and I am lucky I have that from the people I work for. There is a real balance and acceptability that we have to improve but [the FA] know the journey we are going on” – Big Phil Neville tells his England paymasters why they should know Big Phil Neville is still the best person for the job.

I think he left out the ‘One’ at the end of that initial maxim. Then perhaps Barcelona will get desperate enough for a quick-fix coach, and José can make them ‘Less than a Club’” – Justin Kavanagh. “Have you noticed that Mourinho and Donald Trump never appear together, or at the same time? Could it be that they are actually the same person, simply with different hairdos, appearing in different places at different times? They certainly share some similar characteristics, and it’s hard to believe that there could actually be two separate people of this outrageous type” – Alfredo Hamill [funny you should mention that – Fiver Ed].
