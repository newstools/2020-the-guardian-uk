The former Cardiff City and Aston Villa midfielder Peter Whittingham has died at the age of 35, the Welsh club have said. Whittingham had what South Wales police described as “an accidental fall” at a Barry pub on 7 March and had been in hospital with head injuries. The former England Under-21 international started his career at Villa before joining Cardiff in 2007. He played more than 450 times for Cardiff and finished his career at Blackburn Rovers, whom he left in August 2018. “It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35,” Cardiff said. “We are heartbroken. The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. “Our love goes out to his wife, Amanda, their young son and family. They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time. “First and foremost, Peter was a family man – and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality. Then, as a professional footballer – as a Bluebrid – he excelled with talent, ease, grace and humility. Nobody did it better. “The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us.”
