Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We’re moving two miles from our first-floor two-bed flat to a three-bed semi with our young baby. I can hire a large van and get some mates to help out, or I can go with a removal firm for about £450. My wife thinks it’s mad to do it ourselves, but we’re broke at the moment. Is she right? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
