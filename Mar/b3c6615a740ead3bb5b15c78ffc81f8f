Two former college basketball players have died after being diagnosed with Covid-19. David Edwards’ death was confirmed by his former college, Texas A&M, on Monday. He held the Aggies’ single-season record for total assists and played for them between 1991 and 1994. His former teammate, Charles Henderson, paid tribute to Edwards in a post on Facebook. “Never in a million years would I have even imagined my backcourt teammate would go before his time. I just got the news that Dave Edwards passed away. For those that have been praying for him, he is now in a better place,” Henderson wrote. “This coronavirus has hit me in the heart. Dave was one of the fiercest competitors and best point guards that I’ve ever met. Nearly unstoppable.” The New York Post reported that Lee Green died on Monday. He played for St John’s before becoming a police officer on Brooklyn. After retiring from law enforcement, the 49-year-old worked as a DJ. He is not believed to have had any underlying health conditions, and it is suspected he contracted the virus at an event he was DJing. Green played in two NCAA Tournaments during his time with St John’s, which lasted from 1991 to 1994. “My brother, my teammate, it’s kind of hard,” his former teammate Lamont Middleton told the Post. “Cool guy. Everywhere he went Lee had a smile. He had a big personality.” New York state has been hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 outbreak. At one point on Monday, nearly half of confirmed cases in the US were in the state.
