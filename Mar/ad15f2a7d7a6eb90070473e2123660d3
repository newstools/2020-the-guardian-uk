We met Georges Duboeuf through picking grapes for Antonin Coquard in southern Beaujolais. Georges seemed to have the secret of eternal youth. Every year, he would visit the Coquard family vineyards, tall, slim, with black curly hair that never seemed to change, and with a smile for all us grape pickers. His family had worked in wine for centuries, but Georges was determined to raise its quality and profile. He started with a mobile bottling machine, borrowed out of hours from his friend Alexis Lichine, so the wine could directly be sold in bottles instead of via tankers. He invented the idea of beaujolais nouveau and promoted the race to get the first bottles back to London every November. He knew the region by heart, driving the winding paths through hillside vineyards glowing with the golden stone of this glorious region, often with his friend Antonin. The Duboeuf logo on bottles came to represent the best of Beaujolais. He effectively supported the livelihood of thousands of local winemakers and so was an early model for today’s interest in promoting local produce. His museum of wine, the Hameau Duboeuf in Romanèche-Thorins, represents more than just history. At the end of the tour is a vast ballroom. We will for ever treasure the memory of Lynne’s 4ft 10in mother expertly waltzing with a 6ft German boy. You brought us joy, Georges, and we raise a glass to your memory.
