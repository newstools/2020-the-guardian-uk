Re your review of Smile, the play about the legendary Dundee United football manager Jim McLean now on at Dundee Rep theatre (G2, 24 February), I had quite a countercultural experience of the man in the 1970s. I had – with permission – brought two boys in care from the school where I taught in Kent for a holiday to my parents’ in Scotland. I wanted to take them to a Glasgow Celtic match, but Celtic were away to Dundee United. I rang the club’s offices to see if I could get tickets; the phone was answered by McLean himself, and he told me that three tickets would be at reception on the day of the match. Arriving for the match, I went with the boys to pick up and pay for the tickets, to be told they were a gift from the manager. We were seated in the directors’ box among the great and good – and our team won.Danny SullivanBasingstoke, Hampshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
