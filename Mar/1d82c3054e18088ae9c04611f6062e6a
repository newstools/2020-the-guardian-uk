A £600,000 total prize pool will be split evenly between the men’s and women’s competitions in the Hundred this summer. The England and Wales Cricket Board has announced that both competitions will be worth £300,000 in prize money, with the winning men’s and women’s teams earning £150,000 each, the runners-up £75,000, as well an even split for various player awards. The governing body has described the prize pool as “a step towards the long-term commitment to making cricket a gender-balanced sport”, as part of a pledge to invest £20m in the women’s game in the next two years including 40 professional contracts. The matched prize money also mirrors the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup where, like the men’s tournament in October, the winning team in Melbourne on Sunday will take home £770,000. Australia’s Big Bash League also has a total prize pot of £335,000 shared evenly across the men’s and women’s competitions. Like both these short-form tournaments there is a caveat in terms of the wage disparity in the Hundred, where the average contract for female players is £8,000 compared to £66,600 for the men. This gulf was highlighted when eight female marquee players were named last October – including the Australia captain Meg Lanning and South Africa’s Dane van Neikerk – on deals worth £15,000 each, less combined than the £125,000 one top-tier male player makes. The ECB acknowledges the gap, at least, and insists the eight-team tournament is aimed at closing this gap over time depending on the success of the new eight-team 100-ball format. Beth Barrett-Wild, head of the Hundred women’s competition, said: “While we’re aware there is more to do in this space, this is an important step in the right direction. It’s recognition for the women’s players and the huge value they bring to the Hundred. “The ECB is committed to transforming women’s and girls’ cricket, from inspiring young girls to pick up a bat for the first time, through to establishing the women’s game as a professional career option. This announcement today represents one signal of intent towards that commitment.” Heather Knig ht, captain of London Spirit and England, added: “[Equal prize money] is a great announcement for women’s sport. “Women’s professional cricket is on an exciting journey and whilst, there is still a way to go to realise gender-parity, this move from The Hundred is a significant step in the right direction.” Prize money (men and women)Winning team £150,000Runners-up £75,000Third place £50,000MVP £10,000Leading runs £5,000Leading wickets £5,000Leading fielder £5,000 Collective squad salariesMen £1mWomen £120,000 Salary bandsMen £125,000, £100,000, £75,000, £60,000, £50,000, £40,000, £30,000. Captaincy bonus £10,000Women £15,000, £12,000, £9,000, £7,200, £6,000, £4,800 and £3,600. Captaincy bonus: £1,200
