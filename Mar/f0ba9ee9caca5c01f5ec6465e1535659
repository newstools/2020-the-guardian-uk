Sir Frederick Barclay is threatening to launch legal action against the family of his twin brother, David, if they attempt to sell the Ritz London hotel for less than £1bn. The property has become the focal point in a power struggle between the two sides of the once secretive multibillionaire family, which was thrust into the spotlight last week when the high court heard that Frederick had been secretly recorded in the hotel’s conservatory for several months by his nephew. The Barclay brothers have been reviewing the potential sale of parts of their ailing business empire – the Telegraph Media Group, online retailer the Very Group and delivery firm Yodel are all underperforming – and the five-star Ritz is seen as a crown-jewel asset closest to a sale. Reports have centred on a potential sale to a Saudi Arabian private investment firm for about £750m. However, Frederick is understood to have received at least two offers valuing the hotel, and associated properties William Kent House and Aldridge Street offices, in excess of £1bn. Frederick and his daughter Amanda are threatening the legal action over fears that the business is being undervalued in a sale process they have no control over. In January, David Barclay’s son Alistair was caught handling the covert recording device. Less than two weeks later, Amanda, who works at the Ritz, was removed from the company’s board. On the same day, two of David Barclay’s other sons, Aidan and Howard, who in effect run the octogenarian’s businesses, were appointed as directors at the Ritz.
