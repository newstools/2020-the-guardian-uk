As the coronavirus outbreak continues to unfold, many of us have been left with questions. To address some of these, Science Weekly will be bringing scientific questions – some sent in by you – to experts on the frontline. Anushka Asthana and the Today in Focus team will be focusing on everything else; from the government response to the economic impact, the work of healthcare professionals, what it means for those in insecure work and the rest of us, learning to cope with social distancing and self isolation. We are not answering medical questions though – please call NHS111. Make sure to let us know below which team you want to reach. You can send us your questions by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your submissions. We can’t promise we’ll be able to answer all of them as there’s still so much we don’t know. But we will explore as many of them as we can. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
