No, there hasn’t been a glitch in the matrix – we’re doing it all again! It’s time for RuPaul’s Drag Race season 12: the premiere: the second coming. To be fair, watching bright-eyed queens skip into the workroom with a dollar and a dream is the best part of the show. If only to hear the t-shirt friendly catchphrase they decide to coin upon said skipping out. So take a breath, close Grindr and in the inimitable words of Stanley Tucci in The Devil Wears Prada, gird your loins … time to meet the next batch of ladies in lamé! Again … WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. Rock M. Sakura hurricanes into the work room, screeches something unintelligible, then sort of half collapses half throws herself on the floor and starts rotating. She’s dressed head-to-toe in shimmering pink and white Japanese-inspired finery. “Is it cultural appropriation?” she cackles “We’ll find out.” Crikey. Why the premier was so good I think I’d like to have it a second time!🍔 Get ready for me to walk into the werkroom on PART 2 of the @RuPaulsDragRace S12 premiere FRI at 8/7c on @VH1!! #DragRace pic.twitter.com/pwOLKYXxgq Dahlia Sin’s next, and she’s here to take your man. She’s giving Britney Spears circa 2001 … if Britney Spears had clip on earrings and a huge chest tattoo of what could be either the illuminati sign or a Toblerone. “Hope ya saved room for dessert, ‘cuz I brought pie!” It’s Sherry Pie, but no need to remember that – she’s already been disqualified. No, seriously. In, to our knowledge, the first ever instance of this happening, Sherry was officially disqualified and disregarded from this season after allegations of some fairly extreme catfishing. There was talk that she might be edited out altogether, but she clearly hasn’t been. Of course, Drag Race is filmed well in advance, so it’s not like they were able to boot her off the show. On Friday, VH1 and World Of Wonder released a statement saying; “In light of recent developments and Sherry Pie’s statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from RuPaul’s Drag Race. Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned. Sherry will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring.” Gays should run the country. We had Sherry Pie tried and canceled in less than 48 hours but we can’t impeach a criminal president. #DragRace Next, clad in sequin sportswear, it’s Jan! She makes an, admittedly, quite niche reference to something Fergie said after she sang the national anthem in 2018. Unsurprisingly, the other girls don’t get it. We’re on Jan’s side with this - Fergie is a true chanteuse and poet of our times, and anyone who isn’t aware of every single thing she’s ever done needs to open the fridge and have a good think. Fifth in and looking STUNNING, it’s Milwaukee’s Jaida Essence Hall. She says she’s “here to slay the competition”. How original. That said, this is our favourite entrance look of the whole season so far, with the possible exception of Gigi’s harlots of the high seas look last week. Ahoy. Aiden Zhane follows up, in a look that’s striking, original and current. She says “there isn’t really a drag queen out there that you can compare me to.” Well Aiden, for your information, you’re not that original and there are actually several drag queens out there that we can compare you to. We just can’t think of any right now. Again, the queens are tasked to model spring and fall looks. It was a bit discombobulating last week, but now we get it. It lets the judges and audiences get accustomed to the queens and their aesthetics. One of Drag Race’s flaws is that, while the joy is in the hectricity (is that a word?) sometimes it’s a bit too hectic and you have issues remembering who’s who. This new format puts a bit of a stopper on that. Jan seems to be wearing Courtney Act’s face. Jaida looks incredible again. At one point, RuPaul says “punch my titties” for no reason, and everyone laughs hysterically. Both of Rock M. Sakura’s looks are, as we would put it here in jolly old England, camp dear! “TV has raised and shaped me into the person I am today,” she says. We relate. Everyone’s de-dragging and Dahlia “forgot” to wear underwear. The thing about “forgetting” your underwear, is that it makes people fancy you and gets you extra airtime. We see you Dahlia. Also it totally worked, we really fancy Dahlia. What’s her Instagram handle? POV: seeing only $0.97 in my checking account on Monday morning😬 @dahlia_sin #DragRace pic.twitter.com/S1apKaxn6N This week they’re teaming up to do a jazz number – this is a good idea. There’s scope for chair-throwing and anything with chair-throwing is a-ok with me. If you want proof, just watch The Pussycat Dolls’ “Buttons” music video. Everyone’s talking about Fosse but no-one seems to actually know who or what Fosse is. Inevitably, the queens are soon fighting. Ross Matthews is here being exhausting as usual, plus the always gorgeous Michelle Visage and, in a stroke of producing genius, guest judges Thandie Newton and Robyn! Thandie’s bringing strong overexcited mom energy and we love it. She looks ecstatic to be there and comes armed with the best quips. Robyn’s keeping that Swedish cool as always, a breezy blow dry and the hint of a smile. Hi, Robyn. The runway category is “tulle” (not tool as I originally thought, which explains the surprising lack of hammers). Dahlia Sin’s 80s look is 10/10 stunning. Jan looks great too in a space-age construction getup. Jaida Essence Hall and the queen that shall not be named are in the top two, lipsyncing to the best pop song ever made (don’t @ us, we don’t have Twitter) Robyn’s Call Your Girlfriend. Jaida is SMOULDERING as she languorously removes her bracelet. Goosebumps. And she scoops the five thousand dooooollar prize. jaida essence hall really performed a lip sync by herself on the premier of rupaul’s drag race s12 that’s my girl pic.twitter.com/Tp09BCXdos Shadiest moment Last week’s queens all saying “meh” in unison. A unison “meh” is always a winner. Catchphrase watch “I’m frightened but fascinated”. Patent it, market it, shove it on a t-shirt, take our money. Animal print hunt Tepidly tame at only TWO garments this week – Thandie’s giraffe-print outfit and Jan’s crocodile skin fall look. And we’re being generous because crocodile skin doesn’t really count as animal print. Just between us squirlfriends We said it last week cast and we’ll say it again – the absence of trans contestants is all too noticeable. This week’s episode was, it’s probably fair to say, quite a lot weaker than last week’s. A couple of great stand-out stars though, and the dynamics will inevitably shift when the two casts are thrown together. So on to week three, when the fun will really begin. Start. Your. Engines.
