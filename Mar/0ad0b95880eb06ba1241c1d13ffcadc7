At least the very young have absorbed Boris Johnson’s message not to panic (Sketch: Johnson has spent his entire life washing his hands, 4 March). At a recent children’s party, a boy called out “Let’s play coronavirus!” A distinctly contemporary game of tag ensued, the object of which appeared to be to infect as many as possible.Mary SmithBearsted, Kent • Delighted to see Jacob Rees-Mogg recommend the national anthem to accompany hand-washing (Letters, 4 March). Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is a great tune, and with the customary repeat from “Gwlad, gwlad” it affords ample time for a thorough job.Anne CowperLlandeilo Ferwallt, Abertawe • I’d worked out that using the Rees-Mogg accompaniment of God Save the Queen rather than Happy Birthday lost the country an extra 82 years of work if one washed one’s hands nine times a day as teachers have been told. Now Boris Johnson says we have to sing Happy Birthday twice. Does he want to collapse the economy?Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife • Your article asking “Are hugs, kisses and handshakes OK” (3 March) reminded me of one in the Yorkshire Post of 6 July 1918, in which a doctor recommended “the temporary abolition of the pernicious habit of kissing” due to “a flood of sentiment let loose by the war”. He went on: “In urgent cases, where abolition would be a hardship, a small book of kissing coupons could be allowed, provided proper precautions were taken.”Martin KnightHovingham, North Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
