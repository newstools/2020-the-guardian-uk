The surge of inventive modern folk from Cymru continues. Modern is a relative term, of course. Dilyn Afon’s recent debut Cynefin, a beautiful piece of chamber folk delivered in Welsh, uses centuries-old songs to evoke the natural landscape. As a writer of her own material, Aberystwyth’s Georgia Ruth is more thoroughly a modernist, though the centrepiece of this third album is a celebration of May by Edwardian poet Eifion Wyn. Ruth, a talented harpist, keeps the piece stark and intimate before it picks up speed in a pastoral meld of harp, strings and woodwind. Mai is conceived as a celebration of the month, much of it written in the wake of Ruth’s newborn son. In Bloom and Cosmos are dreamy odes to spring, when “someone let the garden in” and the line between grower and grown blurs: “Maybe I am the flower,” ponders Ruth. There’s more grounded material, as in the hospital journey of 7 Rooms or the domestic musings of Close for Comfort, though Ruth’s cool, bright vocals shine brighter away from conventional folk-rock and in the lusher, psych-tinged settings of Madryn. A more consistent album awaits, but Mai is a cheering salute to the incoming season.
