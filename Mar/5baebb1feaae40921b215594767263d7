Watch the giraffes munch their way through afternoon, see the penguins get fed (or a naughty seagull steal a pilchard), coo over the sleepy snow leopard cubs or the lions lolling about in the sun. • Ongoing: For those in the US – or those simply up late at night everywhere else – the Smithsonian national zoo in Washington DC has set up live feeds of its lion enclosure, giant pandas troop, elephants and … naked mole rats. All creatures great and small, etc. • Ongoing: The most joyful animal live feed on the internet must be Monterey Bay Aquarium’s sea otter cam. Watch the otters frolick and swim about, blissfully free of concerns about coronavirus or global economic meltdown. Look how much fun they’re having! • 1-17 May: Head On photo festival in Sydney will move online, with webinars and online events.
