I sympathise with Richard Coles in the loss of his partner (G2, 9 March). On Sunday I hosted an event to celebrate the life of my wife, who died two months ago. The top track for our dancing was Don’t Leave Me This Way by Richard’s former band the Communards, a long-time favourite of my partner’s. However, I cannot agree with the suggestion that Christians suffer equally with others in bereavement. Since my Janis died I have grown to envy Christians for their belief in pearly-gate reunions. This comfort is not available to atheists – for us it really is the end.Bill GeddesWorthing, West Sussex • Your main picture of Richard Coles reminded me that the definition of a gentleman is someone who can play the accordion, but doesn’t.Harry Landis London • Great that Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light has arrived after a wait of eight years. Forget about coronavirus. Sitting with the book, a cup of tea, a slice of toast and marmalade and no interruptions, what a time to be over 70.Kathleen HinesWashington, Tyne and Wear • It isn’t necessary to mishear the lyrics in a hymn in order to be confused by them (Letters, 7 March). I remember my bewilderment as a boy in Sunday school when we sang Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing and came to the line “Here I raise my Ebenezer”. I wondered what was expected of me.Ray JenkinCardiff • Rosie Eliot should consider herself doubly lucky to have the ingredients to make Ottolenghi’s tahini chicken schnitzel (Letters, 9 March), as panic-buying has long since cleared tahini from the shelves in Sevenoaks.Dominic HaslamSevenoaks, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
