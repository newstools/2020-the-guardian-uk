Lewis Hamilton has revealed he has been in self-isolation but is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus, after attending an event with Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau. Elba, the actor, and Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister, have both tested positive for Covid-19. Hamilton met the pair at an event in London on 4 March before flying out to Melbourne for the first race of the Formula One season, which was called off on 13 March. The six-times world champion has said that he has kept himself away from other people since then. “There’s been some speculation about my health, after I was at an event where two people later tested positive for coronavirus,” Hamilton wrote on Instagram. “I wanted to let you know that I’m doing well, feeling healthy and working out twice a day. I have zero symptoms, and it’s now been 17 days since I saw Sophie and Idris. I have been in touch with Idris and happy to hear he is OK. “I did speak to my doctor and double-checked if I needed to take a test but the truth is, there is a limited amount of tests available and there are people who need it more than I do, especially when I wasn’t showing any symptoms at all. So what I’ve done is keep myself isolated this past week, actually since practice was cancelled last Friday and kept my distance from people.”
