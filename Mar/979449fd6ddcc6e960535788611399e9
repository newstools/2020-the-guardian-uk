Ian Thomson refers in his obituary of Nexhmije Hoxha (3 March) to the time in the 1970s when the Albanian regime fell out with China. I visited the country at that time and the rift with China was self-evident: our luggage was searched carefully at the border on entry and the discovery of Paul Scott’s The Chinese Love Pavilion caused immense concern. Explanations that it was just a novel set in India were viewed with great scepticism, and we were told we were lucky not to be arrested as spies.Dr Richard CarterPutney, London • I have a greetings card with a photo of the kitchen range in the house where DH Lawrence grew up, in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire.

It’s amazing how it cheers one up to shred oranges or scrub the floor” (Letters, 5 March).Harland WalshawLympstone, Devon • Don’t perpetuate the term “ultra high net worth individual” (The super-rich: another 31,000 people join the ultra-wealthy elite, 4 March).
