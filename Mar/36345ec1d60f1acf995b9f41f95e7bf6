Most pupils in the UK will remain at home from Friday with schools in England only staying open to supervise vulnerable children and those of key workers. If you are a teacher we would like to hear your suggestions and advice for how parents and carers should teach children at home. What apps and platforms are you using to teach from home? How have you set up your workspace? Do you have any advice for those who do not have much space? What are the best teaching methods for different age groups? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. You can also get in touch via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.
