Rowers compete in an event on picturesque Loch Katrine in the Scottish Highlands, north-west of Stirling. They are surrounded by all the colours of late autumn, captured from a nearby peak by the Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod. The competitors, from the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association, row in old-fashioned wooden boats whose design is based on traditional vessels from Fair Isle in the far north that were used for fishing and transport to nearby Shetland and Orkney. The eight-mile-long freshwater loch is famous as the fictional setting of Sir Walter Scott’s 1810 poem The Lady of the Lake.
