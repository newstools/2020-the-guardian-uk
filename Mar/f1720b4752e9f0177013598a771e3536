Game developer Zynga, known for smartphone hits Merge Dragons!, Words With Friends and FarmVille, has released a Harry Potter-themed puzzle game for mobile devices. Think Candy Crush with wizarding, with match three puzzles that are embellished with potions, spells and other such Potter paraphernalia, and you’ve got the basic idea. Soft-launched in the Philippines, Puzzles and Spells will presumably be available elsewhere in the next few months, although Zynga’s spokesperson has not said when. Bernard Kim, Zynga’s president of publishing, suggested it would feature whimsical storylines inspired by the books, along with “iconic moments” and characters from the series. “We were thinking about the most approachable genre and gameplay, so that’s why we landed on match three,” says Kim, referring to the tile-matching style of games. “Anyone can pick up and play this game, though it’s a little more difficult to master. Like the Potter universe, it’s enjoyable and relatable for everyone, but if you really want to get deep into it, then you can … there are such fun and playful moments of mischief in Harry Potter, and that’s what we want to bring to this game.” The game will be free to play, with optional in-game purchases. Puzzles and Spells is the latest collaboration from Portkey Games, the label set up by Warner Bros to handle Harry Potter-themed video games. So far it has put outHogwarts Mystery and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, a wizarding world version of Pokémon Go by Niantic.
