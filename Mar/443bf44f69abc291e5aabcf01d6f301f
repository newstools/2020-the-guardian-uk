This enabled rents to be affordable as the interest due on the loans was spread over a longer period than with conventional mortgages.Jenny HaynesHorkstow, North Lincolnshire • Since when did it become rightwing to admire beautiful, classically inspired buildings (When classical beauty is in the eye of the rightwing beholder, 29 February)?
