We’d like to hear from people who have tested positive for coronavirus but have since recovered. It is estimated that around 80% of people who are infected with the coronavirus recover, without needing specific treatment. We’d like to know more about the testing and possible treatment for coronavirus, and the impact the virus has had on your social interactions and working life. Did you have to self-isolate at home? Or undergo treatment in hospital? How did your work colleagues, family or friends respond? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. You can also get in touch via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here
