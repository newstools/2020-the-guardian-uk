Joe Montemurro is set to miss a number of matches after Arsenal Women confirmed he has returned to Australia for “family reasons”. Montemurro took over as manager in late 2017 and delivered the Women’s Super League title last year. This season Arsenal sit third in the table, four points behind the leaders, Manchester City, but with a game in hand. “Arsenal Women head coach Joe Montemurro has temporarily returned to Australia due to family reasons,” said a club statement. “Assistant coaches Aaron D’Antino and Leanne Hall will be taking the management of the team while Joe is in Australia. Everyone at the club wishes Joe all the best and looks forward to his return.” It is not yet known when Montemurro will be back, with Arsenal taking on their local rivals Tottenham in the quarter-final of the Women’s FA Cup at Meadow Park on Sunday. Their next league outing is away to Bristol City on 22 March before the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain.
