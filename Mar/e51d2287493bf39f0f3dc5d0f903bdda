The queen of savoury cocktails, Sabor-style. The piquillo peppers, a mild variety that are jarred in oil after being roasted over fire, lend a sweet, smoky flavour to the ultimate brunch and hangover cocktail. Serves 1 For the bloody mary mix (makes about 100ml, for 1 serve) 25g piquillo peppers from a jar, drained60ml tomato juice30g passata For the drink15ml Worcestershire sauce3 drops TabascoSalt and pepper10ml lemon juice40ml fino sherry1 slice lemon, to garnish Rinse the peppers under cold water to wash off the oil, then blend with the tomato juice and passata for 20 seconds, until smooth. Pass through a fine-mesh sieve (ideally a chinois), pressing it through with a spatula or the back of a ladle. To build the drink, first make a spice mix in a small glass or bowl by combining the Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Pour the lemon juice into a highball glass, then add the spice mix and fino. Add 100ml bloody mary mix, stir to combine, then add ice to fill. Garnish with lemon and serve. • José Etura, co-founder, Sabor, London W1.
