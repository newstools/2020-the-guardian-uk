An “irreplaceable” collection of prop guns used in James Bond films has been stolen from a house in Enfield, north London. Five deactivated guns, including Beretta Cheetah and Tomcat pistols from Die Another Day and the iconic Walther PPK handgun used in A View to a Kill are among the weapons reported taken. The Metropolitan Police were called to a burglary in progress at a property in Aldersbrook Avenue, Enfield, at about 8pm on Monday. However, the suspects had fled the scene by the time officers arrived. Neighbours described the intruders as three white males who drove away in a silver vehicle. It is believed the suspects forced entry into the rear of the premises, where they stole the firearms – estimated to be worth more than £100,000. The other stolen weapons include a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum featured in Live and Let Die, and a Llama .22-calibre handgun from Die Another Day. Det Insp Paul Ridley said: “The firearms are very distinctive and bespoke to particular Bond movies. They will almost certainly be recognised by the public and to anyone offered them for sale. “Many are irreplaceable. The Magnum is the only one ever made in which the whole gun is finished in chrome. “The Walther PPK was the last gun used by Roger Moore in A View to a Kill. The owner is very upset his address has been violated and hopes to be reunited with these highly collectable items. “I would urge any members of the public that may have witnessed the burglars arriving and leaving, or who know where the firearms are, or may have been offered these stolen items for sale, to come forward.”
