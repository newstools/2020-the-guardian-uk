The US PGA Championship is expected to be postponed following updated recommendations from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. As efforts continue worldwide to contain the spread of coronavirus the CDC has suggested organisers cancel or postpone events consisting of 50 or more people throughout the United States for the next eight weeks. The US PGA Championship begins in nine weeks’ time at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco but the situation continues to develop rapidly and travel restrictions are already affecting the ability of players to get to the US. The CDC said: “Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of Covid-19 in the United States via travellers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. “Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organisations and communities but also by individuals. “Therefore, CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next eight weeks, organisers (whether groups or individuals) cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States.” The Masters has already been postponed and the Players Championship was cancelled after the first round. PGA Tour events for the next three weeks have also been cancelled. Jack Nicklaus does not think the Masters will be rescheduled. “In all practicality they are postponing but I can’t see any way they would play it at a later date,” Nicklaus said. “How in the world could they work it into the schedule? It wouldn’t be fair to any other tournaments that are later. I think we are probably going to miss the Masters this year, that’s just my opinion, but I think it makes logical sense.”
