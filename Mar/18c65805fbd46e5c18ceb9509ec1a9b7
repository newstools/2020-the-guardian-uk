Kosovo’s government has fallen after only 50 days in power, with the junior governing coalition partner pushing through a no-confidence vote following disagreements with the prime minister. The prime minister, Albin Kurti, of the leftwing Self-Determination Movement, may take two weeks to try to form a new government or an early parliamentary election will be called. A 12-hour long debate on the no-confidence vote culminated in a vote of 82 in favour, 32 against and one abstention. The government will continue in a caretaker role. Last week Kurti fired then-interior minister Agim Veliu of the centre-right Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, for not being in line with government policy on containing the coronavirus. The LDK leader Arben Gashi said this effectively ended the coalition because his party was not consulted first. Kurti accused his coalition partner of joining forces with president Hashim Thaci, who he considers the “engine behind the scene” for a purported secret effort to arrange a territorial trade with Serbia. Prominent politicians in the two countries have said Thaci and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, have been discussing a land swap. Kosovo was part of Serbia until an 1998-1999 armed uprising by the ethnic Albanian majority triggered a bloody Serbian crackdown. That prompted a Nato bombing campaign against Serbia to force its troops out of Kosovo in 1999. Serbia refuses to recognise Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence.
