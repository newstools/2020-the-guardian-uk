In the summary of the life of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum (Profile: will reputation survive, 6 March), it is stated that “he studied at Cambridge.” Well, not quite. In 1966 he studied in Cambridge, at what was the Bell English language school (now the Bell Educational Trust). In the scale of the accusations against him, a triviality, though perhaps a relief for the University of Cambridge that the sheikh can’t claim alumnus status. He could, of course, if he hasn’t already, endow a chair in racehorse studies, with the Duke of Cambridge as patron.Bruce Ross-SmithOxford • It’s fascinating that Boris Johnson cites the warrior queen Boudicca as one of the “five women who have shaped my life” (Pass notes, 5 March), given that she sought her redress by bringing intense violence against the British government and butchering innocent children, women and men in their thousands in St Albans, Colchester and London.
