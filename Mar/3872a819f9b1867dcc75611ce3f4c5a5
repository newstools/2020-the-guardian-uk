Parts of Queensland’s coast are expected to be hit by strong winds as a tropical cyclone brews over the Coral Sea and heads towards Norfolk Island. The cyclone was expected to develop into a category one system on Saturday night as it tracked south-east away from the Queensland coast, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Meteorologist Alex Majchrowski said the cyclone was expected to turn into a category two system on Sunday before it approached Norfolk Island on Monday. As it passed through the island, it was expected to turn into a tropical low but Majchrowski warned it would still have the intensity of a category two tropical cyclone. The weather system was not expected to affect mainland Queensland but strong winds were forecast to hit the coastal waters south of Mackay on Sunday, with gale warnings in place for the Fraser Island coast, Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. “We are not expecting much weather-wise for Queensland, it’s really just those strong winds and gale warnings,” Majchrowski said.
