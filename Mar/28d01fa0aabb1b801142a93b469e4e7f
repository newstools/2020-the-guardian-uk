Alasdair Gray was one of my favourite writers, and featured prominently in the MA dissertation that I wrote in 1987 on experimental novelists. After I sent him a series of questions, he very kindly replied by writing between the lines of my letter, along the lines of a palimpsest. Appropriately it became part of the finished piece, and I still have it today as an abiding memory of a multitalented artist.
