People have been asked to avoid unnecessary social contact, pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues to stem the spread of coronavirus, following an announcement from Boris Johnson on Monday. In light of these measures, we want to hear what how your high street is affected by the virus. Are pubs, restaurants and other social venues still open? Are fewer people out shopping? How are local businesses coping? Do you have any concerns? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. You can also get in touch via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists may be in contact for more information.
