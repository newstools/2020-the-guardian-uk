The National League, National League North and National League South competitions have been suspended indefinitely, the National League Board has announced. The season was halted on 16 March after the Football Association advised “all grassroots football in England is postponed for the foreseeable future” due to the coronavirus outbreak, with matches initially scheduled to restart on 3 April. But after a meeting of its board on Tuesday, a statement from the National League confirmed that fixtures will now be suspended indefinitely. “In consideration of the very serious and unprecedented national public health emergency caused by the coronavirus, the Board has taken the decision to suspend the National League, National League North and National League South competitions indefinitely,” it read. “The National League is currently obtaining specialist legal advice, is consulting regularly with The Football Association and other stakeholders, and is committed to involving its member clubs in a pending decision on how best to conclude the 2019/20 season.”
