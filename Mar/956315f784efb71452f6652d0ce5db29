The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has risen to 57,298 and 455 people have died of the disease here, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Monday. Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week, according to NPR, which is partly why this daily rise in confirmed cases is so high. Germany’s testing rate has also led to its mortality rate seeming lower than in other countries – with more tested, fewer people as a proportion of confirmed cases are dying. The highest number of cases, 13,989, are in the southern state of Bavaria, where the disease first appeared in Germany. Although Germany is not in a complete lockdown, its schools are closed, as are its restaurants, shops, and theatres. Gatherings of more than two people, except those who live together, are not allowed. The country is not planning to lifted any restrictions before 20 April.
