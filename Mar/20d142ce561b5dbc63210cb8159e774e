Food has become a major issue for us all and, as an 80-year old, I have been unsuccessful in securing home deliveries from local supermarkets, and I am now exhorted not to shop at all. To my rescue came a knight in shining armour, in the form of John Vincent, co-founder of Leon restaurants. I emailed him, having heard him explain on the radio that the distribution of food needed better organisation. In response, he sent me a welcome message, promising a gift if I sent my address. Imagine how I felt when a delivery van arrived with a bouquet of flowers, followed by a second delivery van with two large boxes of excellent products, all sustainably sourced. I now have a delicious range of produce for at least three weeks. What an amazing act of generosity.Kirsty ThomasDurham City • If vulnerable people are having problems getting food deliveries via “official” channels they may be able to get help through a local Covid-19 Mutual Aid group. See if there is a local group near you.Pam LauranceLondon
