As countries close their borders around the world, the Australian government has urged Australians abroad to return home as soon as possible. We would like to hear from Australians overseas about their experiences trying to get home. Which country are you in and are you experiencing any difficulties getting home? If you are unable to travel home, what are your plans? We would also like to hear from anyone else who is trying to return home from another country.
