Last week, we published a 60-song playlist of soothing songs to reduce the stresses of self-isolation and the coronavirus outbreak. We asked you for your suggestions, and you responded with hundreds of songs. Certain artists were picked again and again – John Martyn, Pink Floyd, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Al Green – but there was also a huge range of styles that people found calming: lover’s rock, ambient, 80s pop, spiritual jazz and more. After excising some tunes that most people will find profoundly stressful (whoever picked Meshuggah’s Koloss, if you’re not trolling, I salute you), and picking out the first selection per reader comment, here is a playlist of your soothing faves. Work pressures mean we don’t have time to put it into Apple Music and other streaming services, but any bored self-isolators are welcome to make their own and share in the comments below!
