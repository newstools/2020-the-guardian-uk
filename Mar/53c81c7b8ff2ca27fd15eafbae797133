Air New Zealand has told investors that the coronavirus outbreak means it cannot predict how the business will fare this year as the economic impact outstripped its already downgraded outlook. The carrier’s chief executive has also taken a pay cut as it braces for a greater-than-expected hit from virus-related closures and travel bans that are hurting the wider aviation industry. Air NZ in February predicted the Covid-19 hit to its financial year earnings in 2020 would be in the range of $NZ35m- $NZ75m, due to lower demand and capacity cuts. The company on Monday said financial impact is now likely to be more significant than previously estimated. “And with the situation evolving at such a rapid pace, the airline is not in a position to provide an earnings outlook to the market at this time,” Air New Zealand said in statement. The company has already cut flights to Hong Kong, suspended Shanghai services until March, and Seoul flights from March to June. Total capacity into Asia has been slashed by 26%, and total overall network capacity cut by approximately 10% since the coronavirus outbreak started. Qantas on Friday announced it would cut more international flights due to falling demand. Its latest cuts to destinations including Tokyo, Sapporo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Auckland are on top of its grounding the equivalent of 18 planes as it cut international and domestic capacity last month. Air NZ on Monday also announced chief executive Greg Foran voluntarily offered to reduce his base pay of $NZ1.65m by approximately 15%, or $NZ250,000, with the support of the board. Air NZ’s executive team will also extend their salary freeze that has been in place since May 2019 First half profit fell by 33%t to $NZ101 million last month. The carrier’s ASX-listed share price has plunged 30% so far in 2020 to a near-three year low of $1.99.
