• The Berlin Philharmonic has opened up its digital concert hall for this next month, giving free access to hundreds of past concerts in its famous Berlin venue and the chance to watch forthcoming events live, albeit played behind closed doors. Registration is required, and the voucher must be redeemed before 31 March. • Ivan Fischer and his Budapest Festival Orchestra will be livestreaming nightly chamber concerts in a series they have called Quarantine Soirées on 16, 17 and 18 March, at 1945pm (6.45pm GMT). • Vienna State Opera has opened its archives and is offering a different opera available to watch each day, for free, via its streaming platform. Today’s offering (16 March) is Adam Fischer conducting Das Rheingold in a performance recorded in 2016; you can catch the rest of the Ring cycle later this month, plus from Falstaff to Figaro and Eötvös’s Tri Sestry (Three Sisters) – not staged in the UK since 2001 – there’s a mouthwatering array. • Pianist Igor Levit is broadcasting nightly “House Concerts” on Twitter. • New York’s Metropolitan Opera is streaming past productions from its award-winning Live in HD series of cinema transmissions while the opera house is closed. Productions will be available from 7.30pm EDT (11.30pm GMT) for 20 hours. • Many UK organisations livestream concerts and make them available via YouTube or other channels. Check out the Wigmore Hall, which has a huge array of chamber music concerts free to watch, or the London Symphony Orchestra.
