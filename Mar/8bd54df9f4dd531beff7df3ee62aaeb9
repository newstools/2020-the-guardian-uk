This year’s Brit awards may have been criticised for its wobbly commitment to diversity, failing to promote enough female talent. But one nomination was on point when south London newcomers D-Block Europe became the first rap act in over 20 years to be tipped for best British group. Remarkably, the prolific collective released three top 10 album-mixtapes last year and graduated to headlining arenas, yet their star Young Adz has found time to make this surprise posse drop with scene veterans Skepta and Chip. D-Block Europe’s signature “rap wave” sound, basically pornographic lyrics slathered over languid tropical trap, floats nicely alongside Chip’s melodic flow on breezy tracks such as Golden Brown. Skepta brings all his cheeky, chest-puffing energy to every verse to balance Adz’s enervated, adenoidal Auto-Tune croon. The trio’s appetite for drugs, women and money never wavers from first to last track. Yet the more introspective songs, such as the spectral Traumatised and thoughtful High Road, tell powerful stories about their journey to success, and prove that D-Block Europe’s imperial phase is far from its end.
