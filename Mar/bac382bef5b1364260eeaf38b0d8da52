We are all feeling anxious. Worried for loved ones, learning to cope with social distancing and beginning to consider how this pandemic will change our lives. But while there is a temptation to stay glued to the news as each new update is rolled out, there is no doubt that we’re all in need of – and deserve – some joy. Look no further: here are all of the things this week that have made us smile in these gloomy times. (Do the right thing and add yours in the comment thread, please!) In times of great need, animal videos should be state-mandated self-care. This video of penguins exploring a Chicago aquarium after it closed to the public is exactly that. oh my god, the chicago aquarium closed due to coronavirus, so they let the penguins run around and check out the other exhibits. (staff was present.) pic.twitter.com/YGa8CugymE Kudos to anyone who knew that a penguin would approach the stairs in this way. close your eyes. imagine how you think a penguin walks down stairs. wrong. it’s better than thatpic.twitter.com/fYzoiin5vb On Friday, Spain imposed a 15-day state of alarm that restricted free movement except for those traveling to work, to get food or health medication or for caregiving. This guy sneaking out of the house in a disguise may be irresponsible, but you have to applaud the effort. pic.twitter.com/Mvjovkzvw3 This week two siblings from Columbus, Ohio, aged six and nine, decided to hold a spontaneous porch concert for their 78-year-old neighbor, after hearing she was voluntarily self-quarantining due to the pandemic. My elderly neighbor is self-isolating. So the neighbor kids are playing her a cello concert from her patio. pic.twitter.com/g6Nr2HNVho When Cardi B shared her fears over the coronavirus to Instagram last week, the clip immediately went viral . But she couldn’t have predicted that she’d end up charting on iTunes because of it. That’s exactly what happened, after an artist remixed her screeching: “Coronavirus! Coronavirus! Shit is getting real.” The result turned out to be pretty catchy. “As a public service in these stressful times I’d like to offer, as a palate cleanser, the most embarrassing moment of my life,” began a 15-tweet thread by writer Anbara Salam this week. We’ll leave you to follow the detail. As a public service in these stressful times I'd like to offer, as a palate cleanser, the most embarrassing moment of my life.10ish years ago, my ex bf and I visited a spa in Germany. It's swimsuits in the pool but you have to be naked in the sauna. Btw I speak no German.  1/ This video showcases just a few of the questions you might get from your children this week. I don’t have kids, but this has me wheezing 😂 pic.twitter.com/opL8X7nKWN As the rest of the world increasingly looks to Italy to understand what life under government-mandated quarantine might look like, there have been some unexpected revelations. The first is that Italians are very good at singing and very good at balconies, but when you combine the two, it is magical. Italians in lockdown all over Italy are keeping each other company by singing, dancing and playing music from the balconies. A thread to celebrate the resilience of ordinary people. This is Salerno: pic.twitter.com/3aOchqdEpn But the prize from the category of “things we learnt about Italians in quarantine” this week has to go to this Italian DJ, who really gave a new meaning to “working from home” for those in quarantine. Since noone in Italy can really leave their house...This DJ in Palermo is doing his work on his balcony 🤣📽️ FB/Salvatrice Lo Giudice pic.twitter.com/h7xOkUfz6W Please send us in all the things you’ve found funny this week – we all need it.
