The Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, tried to dampen down injury concerns over Dan Biggar by insisting the fly-half will play against England on Saturday. The team’s head coach, Wayne Pivac, named the Northampton player in the team for the Guinness Six Nations fixture at Twickenham, despite him injuring his knee while on club duty last weekend. Wales had trained this week with Jarrod Evans in the fly-half role and Sam Davies officially called into the squad as back-up. There were suggestions that Biggar would not be fit to face England with Davies not released back to the Dragons for their game on Friday night against Treviso and travelling with the Wales squad as cover. But Jones said that Biggar had trained on Friday and passed a fitness test, insisting he was expecting the 30-year-old to start. Jones said: “I can’t guarantee you anything really, can I because I am not a medical expert. All I know is he is on the team sheet and he is going to play. “Thankfully Dan has come through and is available this week. He trained fine today and we are looking forward to tomorrow. “I have seen Dan move and shake. I have seen him kicking, I have seen him passing so I am not a medical professional, but I can tell you he is going to play tomorrow.”
