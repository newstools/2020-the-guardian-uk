As we work to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, all of us – individuals, families, communities, and the worlds of business, finance and government – are reminded of the importance of thinking, planning and budgeting for the long term. It is essential to deal with coronavirus as it is – a global emergency – but it is clear we must work harder to predict and prepare for the existential risks we face. Not only the threat of pandemics, but the climate crisis and unchecked technological advancements. This week, as parliament scrutinises emergency Covid-19 legislation, Caroline Lucas will introduce a much longer-term proposal, the wellbeing of future generations bill. As co-sponsors of the bill, our aim is to enshrine long-term thinking, and the voices of future generations, at the heart of decision-making. The bill, which is also being steered through the House of Lords by John Bird, is inspired by the model in Wales, where their future generations commissioner is taking long-term thinking into the mainstream. This bill represents the need for cultural shift, which will take time. But with the eyes of future generations upon us, it also presents parliament with an opportunity to act today for tomorrow, and level up opportunity between current and future generations.
