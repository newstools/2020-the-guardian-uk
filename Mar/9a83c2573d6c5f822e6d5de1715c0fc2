Perhaps Led Zeppelin and Taurus, not to mention George Harrison and The Chiffons (in respect of My Sweet Lord and He’s So Fine), and even Thomas Edison and Sir Joseph Swan (the light bulb) might like to bear in mind the insight to be found Paul Souriau’s Théorie de l’invention, published in 1881: “Invention is not creation ‘out-of-the-blue’, but rather a combination of pre-existing ideas” (Editorial, 11 March). This concept was further developed in Arthur Koestler’s The Act of Creation (1964): “The creative act is not an act of creation in the sense of the Old Testament. It does not create something out of nothing; it uncovers, selects, reshuffles, combines, synthesises already existing facts, ideas, faculties, skills. The more familiar the parts, the more striking the new whole”.Dennis SherwoodExton, Rutland • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
