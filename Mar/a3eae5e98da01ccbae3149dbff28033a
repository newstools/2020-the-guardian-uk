My husband passed away 16 years ago. I threw myself into my children’s and grandchildren’s lives. Then I got a Facebook friend request from someone I knew a long time ago. We immediately connected. He asked me about my marriage and I told him I have not dated anyone since my husband died. He told me he has been married for 20 years but there is no intimacy. They are just best friends. I tend to believe him, as they are never together. Is this possible? I love everything about him. He is everything my husband was not. Everything I need. We see each other twice a year. He lives very far from me. I do not want to marry him. I like it just the way it is. I just don’t know how to process this.
