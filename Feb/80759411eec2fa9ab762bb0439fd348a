An Australian woman has come out of her coma, two months after the volcano eruption on New Zealand’s White Island, to be told the blast killed her husband and daughter. Adelaide woman Lisa Dallow has woken from her coma in Melbourne’s Alfred hospital and is in a serious but stable condition. She was told the tragic news about her husband, Gavin Dallow, and 15-year-old daughter Zoe Hosking, News Corp reported on Tuesday. The family was on a day trip to White Island while cruising on the liner Ovation of the Seas when the volcano erupted on 9 December, killing 21. Dallow, a lawyer, was farewelled at Adelaide Oval on 10 January in a service in front of about 600 mourners. Zoe’s service is yet to be held. Lisa Dallow, an engineer with Santos, was flown to Australia after the eruption with burns to more than half her body. Of the 47 people reportedly on the island at the time, 19 died instantly or later succumbed to their injuries. Two people, Hayden Marshall-Inman of New Zealand and Winona Langford of Australia, were initially listed as missing before being presumed dead on 23 January. Most of the victims were Australian tourists. A Melbourne man, Paul Browitt, died in January at the Alfred. His daughter Krystal also died. His other daughter, Stephanie, remains in the Alfred.
