Federal prosecutors investigating Boeing are examining whether the US planemaker knowingly misled the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) while it was seeking approval for its 737 Max jet, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. Boeing said it was cooperating with the US Department of Justice investigation. The prosecutors in recent months questioned several Boeing employees focusing on whether Mark Forkner, a top pilot at the company, intentionally lied to the regulator about the nature of new flight control software on the jet, according to the report. A lawyer for Forkner did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Forkner had said he might have unintentionally misled regulators, in a series of internal messages from 2016 that became public in October. The messages appeared to have been the first publicly known observations that the MCAS anti-stall system behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service. The comments by Forkner, who has since left Boeing, were among those pinpointed by US lawmakers in hearings in Washington as evidence Boeing knew about problems with flight control software well before two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in October 2018 and March 2019 killed 346 people. The FAA did not immediately respond to Reutersâ€™ requests for comment.
