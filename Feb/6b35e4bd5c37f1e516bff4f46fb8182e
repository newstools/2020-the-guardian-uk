Music is a huge part of my life, and this “rocktail” is inspired by my favourite LP, Appetite for Destruction by Guns N’ Roses – it’s colourful, loud and proud, just like the album. At the restaurant, we garnish it with an edible flower and draw a love heart on top of the egg white with grenadine, though you may decide that’s a cheffy flourish too far. Serves 150ml gin – we use JJ Whitley20ml passion fruit syrup15ml passion fruit puree10ml lime juice50ml egg whitesChampagne or prosecco, to top1 viola, to garnish (optional)Grenadine, to decorate (optional) Put everything, bar the fizz and garnishes, in a cocktail shaker, hard shake to set the egg white, then add a handful of ice and hard shake again. Pour into a flute, top with champagne or prosecco, garnish with a viola (and draw a grenadine heart on top, if you wish), and serve with a reusable straw. • Simon Wood, Wood Manchester
