Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. We’re a couple in our 50s and my partner wants a dog. My concern is that we go on holiday abroad three times a year, so the cost of kennelling/doggy day care/pet sitters will be enormous. How do others solve this problem? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
