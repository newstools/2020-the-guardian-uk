England will have to defend the SheBelieves Cup without their talismanic European Player of the Year Lucy Bronze, after the right-back withdrew from the squad with a calf injury. The Lionesses are due to fly to the US on Sunday for the friendly tournament at which they play the world champions the USA for the first time since losing to them in a World Cup semi-final, before facing Japan and Spain. Phil Neville’s side hope to turn a corner after a poor run since that defeat. They have won twice since, with less-than-convincing victories in Portugal and the Czech Republic not enough to cover a string of below-par performances. “Disappointed not to be fit for camp,” Bronze tweeted. “But a good opportunity to some new faces … good luck ladies. Haven’t missed a single camp and been present at every single game for the past 5 years. Gonna have massive FOMO [fear of missing out] next week.” Bronze had a stellar 2019, winning the treble with Lyon before being a standout player at the World Cup, earning her the silver ball behind Megan Rapinoe, and finishing second to the American for the women’s Ballon d’Or. She joins a worryingly lengthy England injury list also featuring the Arsenal forward Beth Mead, the goalkeeper Karen Bardsley, the centre-back Aoife Mannion, who has also played at right-back, and Fran Kirby. In place of Bronze Neville has called in the 21-year-old forward Alessia Russo, who was due to train with the squad. Russo, who is at university in the US and plays for North Carolina Tar Heels, helped England to bronze at the 2018 Under-20 World Cup and has been capped at every age-group level. Neville’s youthful squad could also lose the goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck, who landed awkwardly and left the pitch on a stretcher during Manchester City’s 3-3 draw with Chelsea on Sunday, and the West Ham defender Grace Fisk, who was substituted because of an injury against Liverpool.
