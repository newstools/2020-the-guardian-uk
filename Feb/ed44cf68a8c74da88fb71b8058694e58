Local authorities have had their money slashed by up to 40%. The idea that they could invest in courts and facilities is, I am afraid, pie in the sky. In a constituency such as mine, knife crime and gun crime are souring. I thank God for the basketball facilities we have at Ducketts Common and Finsbury Park Basketball is a good escape from the rest of the world Our vision for the Royals was to create a brand that was a real force for change for young Londoners … Operating an elite professional team in the British Basketball League is no longer viable so we must cease trading Playing basketball makes you challenge yourself and pushes you to get better I would rather see my family everyday and play over here and make a good salary but that is just not possible There’s not much opportunity to play basketball as a woman Basketball is something I can take my stress out on Basketball has helped me build my friendships, my confidence as a person and even helped me through my work Basketball means everything to me and keeps me occupied … it’s also a reason why people stay out of trouble We need proper grassroots basketball, but we absolutely need the prospect of being successful in the elite game
