Prep 10 minCook 20-25 minServes 4-6 500g cooked kidney beans 80g glutinous rice flour200g white rice flour60g fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped (or grated)60g shallot, peeled and very finely chopped10g paprika10g salt20ml peanut oilSunflower or vegetable oil, for deep-frying Roughly chop the kidney beans, put them in a bowl with all the other ingredients, then mix with your hands until everything comes together into a sort of dough – make sure the beans aren’t completely mashed, though, because you want the fritters to keep some beany texture. Shape the mix into 80-100g patties, then deep-fry in batches at 190C for three or four minutes, until cooked through and nicely coloured all over. Serve as part of a selection of starters with any chilli sauce of your liking. Prep 15 minMarinate 6 hr-plusCook 15 minServes 4-6 20ml vegetable oil20ml fish sauce½ tsp turmeric powder 1½ tsp ground black pepper 1½ tsp salt 6 star anise 20g fresh ginger, peeled 5 garlic cloves, peeled 1 large green chilli, seeds and pith removed if you don’t like too much heat 10ml dark soy sauce2kg diced pork shoulderWooden or bamboo skewers, soaked in water for a couple of hours For the dipping sauce50g coriander50g mint50g ginger, peeled and roughly choppedJuice of 2 limesSalt and pepper, to taste80ml peanut oil To make the dipping sauce, put everything in a food processor or blender and blitz to a smooth paste. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside while you make the skewers. In a food processor, blend everything bar the pork into a smooth paste, then scrape out into a bowl or high-sided dish. Add the pork, toss with your hands to coat, then cover, refrigerate and leave to marinate for at least six hours. When you’re ready to cook, stick the diced pork on to skewers, then grill (or barbecue) for three or four minutes on each side, until cooked through; alternatively, roast them at 240C (220C fan)/465F/gas 9 for 15 minutes, so they pick up some colour, then turn down the oven to 140C (120C fan)/285F/gas 1 and cook for 10 minutes more, or until cooked through. Transfer to a platter and serve with the dipping sauce alongside. Prep 30 minCook 45 minServes 4-6 2 medium white onions, peeled4 large garlic cloves, peeled50g fresh ginger, peeled1 green or red birds’ eye chilli4 tbsp peanut oil1kg boneless chicken thigh, diced5 tsp ground turmeric3 tsp ground paprika50-60ml fish sauce 1.5 litres chicken stock200ml coconut milk (ie,½ tin) 4-6 Asian shallots, peeled and left whole4 tbsp chickpea flour, toasted in a heavy frying pan till lightly tanned500ml water400g cooked egg noodles, fresh or cooked from dry 1-2 limes, halved for squeezing To serve2 limes, cut into wedges6 medium-boiled eggs, peeled and halved2 Asian shallots, peeled and finely sliced3 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced1 big handful coriander leaves, choppedDried roasted chilli flakes100g rice noodles, deep-fried until puffed up, and drained on kitchen towel(optional)Fish sauce, to taste Finely chop the onions, garlic, ginger and chilli (or blitz them in a food processor). Warm the oil in a large, sturdy saucepan on a medium-low heat, then sweat the onion mix for 10 minutes, until soft and slightly golden. Add the chicken, turmeric, paprika and a dash of fish sauce, and cook, stirring, until the chicken turns white and starts to sear. Add the stock, cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the coconut milk and whole shallots. Turn the heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through – you should now have a velvety and aromatic chicken coconut broth on a low simmer. Put the chickpea flour in a jug, pour in 500ml boiling water and stir until smooth. Pour this bit by bit into the broth, stirring, until it thickens; don’t overdo it – you may not need all the chickpea flour mix. Add fish sauce to taste and water to dilute, if need be, then leave to simmer on a low heat for five minutes while you get the noodles and garnishes ready. Ladle the broth into four or six large bowls, add 60-70g cooked noodles to each and top with the chicken pieces. Garnish with boiled a boiled egg halves, shallots, spring onions, and lots of coriander and freshly squeezed lime, and serve with the other garnishes on the side for everyone to add to taste.
