Portuguese surfer Alex Botelho was rushed to hospital where he is “stable and conscious” after being involved in a serious incident at the notorious Nazaré big wave surfing spot on the north Atlantic coast. Botelho ran into trouble in a big swell when, following a wipeout, he was rescued by his partner Hugo Vau on a jetski. With both men on board, they were unable to outrun a wall of white water rushing up behind them before the craft was hit by another wave from the front. The pair were sent flying off the jetski and into the air before further waves pounded down on them. An apparently unconscious Botelho was washed towards the shore where rescue crews scrambled from the beach to drag him to safety before putting him on a spinal board. He was taken to hospital where his condition was being monitored. “Currently, he is stable and conscious,” the World Surf League said. “He will stay at the hospital for further evaluation. A heartfelt thank you to the safety and medical teams for their quick response. We are wishing Alex a full and speedy recovery.” Nic Von Rupp, another Portuguese big wave surfer, said the alarming series of events was difficult to watch. “Today I was confronted with the reality of our sport,” he wrote on Instagram. “Heartbreaking watching my brother [Botelho] between life and death right in front of the eyes of the world. Honestly, very few would have survived.” It is the first time the WSL’s Big Wave world tour has visited Nazaré, which is known for its dangerous conditions, caused by distinctive underwater terrain that can produce massive waves of up to 30 metres (100ft). Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa holds the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed when he took on a 24m monster at Nazaré in 2017.
