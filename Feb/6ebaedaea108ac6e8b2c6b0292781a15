Some men feel pressure to have children by a certain age. While the female biological clock is often discussed, less attention is given to men who want to become fathers. We would love to hear from men who are broody and feeling pressure to have children by a certain age. We are interested in hearing in detail from men who feel pressure to have kids by a certain age. What are the factors stopping you? What concerns do you have about not being able to? How do you feel about this pressure when it is not acknowledged? How have you been organising your life to prepare for the possibility of children? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below.
