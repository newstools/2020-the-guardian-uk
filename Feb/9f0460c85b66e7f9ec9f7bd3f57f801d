More than a year after Ladbrokes claimed that a “glitch” in its online betting software had been addressed and customers affected had received goodwill payments in settlement, evidence has emerged that a number of its clients may still have a claim against the bookie after being issued with a unique receipt number for a bet that was later described as having been cancelled. One case involves Patricia O’Dowd, who believed that a £2,000 bet on Altra Vita, a 6-4 winner at Bath in June 2018, had been accepted since a receipt number – 0001839 – was issued against it. After the race the £2,000 stake was returned to her account, but there was no payment of £3,000 in winnings. When O’Dowd complained, Ladbrokes supplied a spreadsheet of activity on the account, on which the £2,000 bet did not appear. On closer inspection, however, the receipt numbers on the list jumped from 0001838 to 001840. Bet 0001838 was on the 6.20 at Bath, while 0001840 was on the 7.25 on the same card. Altra Vita’s race was the one in between, at 6.50. Oddly, a spreadsheet sent to O’Dowd four days later did include the disputed bet, while listing the return as zero. “In January 2019, Ladbrokes claimed they had contacted all customers affected and made goodwill settlements in full on all bets that would have been winners,” Paul Fairhead, whose Twitter account @BoycottBetFred assists punters with disputes, said on Thursday. “The O’Dowd case appears to disprove this claim. “Ibas [the Independent Betting Adjudication Service] have yet to make a ruling on any case involving ‘cancelled’ bets, as Ladbrokes have backed down and settled once Ibas had become involved. The cases I have assisted with where a legal claim has been filed have also been settled before a court hearing. Given these facts, I find it quite astonishing that Ladbrokes continue to fob off customers who have had a similar, if not identical, experience with them.” Ladbrokes has yet to respond to a request for comment on the case. Details have also emerged of a case involving a customer who placed a €25 (£20) bet on Dubai Horizon to win at Sandown in September 2018. A receipt suggested the bet had been placed successfully and even that the odds had been boosted, but no winnings appeared in the customer’s account. When the customer complained, Ladbrokes responded there had been insufficient funds in the account to cover the bet. However, the bookie has so far failed to explain how, if this was the case, its system allowed the punter to see a bet receipt, and did not warn that his account balance was too low to fund it. Ladbrokes has not responded to a request for comment here either. Sandown’s Royal Artillery Gold Cup meeting has become the ninth jumpsfixture to be lost to the weather since last weekend, abandoned thismorning due to waterlogging an hour before the scheduled inspection at 8am. That leaves Fakenham as the centre of the jumping world today - not aphrase that you can use too often - and the Norfolk track could have aCheltenham Festival candidate on the card in the shape of PaulNicholls’s Greaneteen (2.10), an entry in next month’s Arkle Trophy.Bryony Frost takes the reins on the six-year-old, who made a solid start tohis chasing career with a win at Ascot in December and then followed upimpressively on his handicap debut after a long trip to Musselburgh 13 daysago. This is quite a quick turnaround but Greaneteen had any amount in hand last time and could put a dent in his current Arkle price of 66-1 thisafternoon. Penny Mallow (3.50) also has an obvious chance on the same card whilethere are also a couple of decent bets to be had on the all-weather atLingfield Park. Phuket Power (3.10) was a long way clear of the thirdhorse home when second in a strong time over track and trip earlier thismonth, while Its Nice Tobe Nice (4.40) made a promising handicap debut atKempton last time and runs off the same mark here.
