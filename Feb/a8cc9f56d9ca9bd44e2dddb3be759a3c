Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our boiler is just six years old, but has broken down twice in the past year (out of warranty) with expensive callouts. We were told we had the “Rolls-Royce” of boilers, but have had to pay Rolls-Royce-style repair charges. What is the most reliable boiler to buy, especially for parts and servicing? We have a large four-bed house and a combi boiler won’t work. Do you have a problem readers could solve?
