Neil Lennon praised Celtic’s resilience after they won 2-1 at Aberdeen despite being drawn into a battle with the Dons and the remnants of Storm Dennis. At a windswept Pittodrie, Celtic took the lead through Callum McGregor after 10 minutes but were pegged back before half-time by Ash Taylor’s composed finish. It looked like a draw would be the outcome before Kristoffer Ajer coolly scored an 81st-minute winner. “I’m thrilled. It’s a massive win in treacherously difficult conditions to play football,” Lennon said. “All credit to the players who dug out a marvellous result for us. “You can’t always play slick, quick football and we had to grind it out. We didn’t want to drop points but it was perhaps looking like we would. A point a Pittodrie is sometimes a decent result and in these conditions the game could have gone either way. “We’ve a bit of character and resilience. We’re not getting ahead of ourselves, there’s a lot of football yet to play but in the context of the run we’re on it’s a big win.” Rangers remain 10 points behind Celtic after beating Livingston 1-0 at Ibrox. In a match that was postponed for 24 hours owing to a waterlogged pitch, the midfielder Scott Arfield scored with a drive in the 59th minute. Alfredo Morelos and Florian Kamberi also had the ball in the net only to be ruled offside. The Livingston goalkeeper Ryan Schofield made three superb first-half saves, including tipping Andy Halliday’s effort on to the bar. Steven Gerrard claimed Morelos’s strike at 1-0 should have stood and that Rangers should have had a penalty for an apparent handball by the defender Ciaron Brown that stopped Connor Goldson getting on the end of a corner. “We aren’t firing on all cylinders at the minute, so it is important you get over the line but we could have done it more convincingly,” the Rangers manager said. “Disappointed in the officials today, I must say,” he added. “Morelos’ one is onside and there is a stonewall penalty. It is a blatant handball.”
