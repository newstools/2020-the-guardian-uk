He had the first UK No 1 of the decade and was named best male artist at the Brit awards this week. But now Stormzy may have clinched the ultimate accolade: an unlimited supply of Greggs vegan sausage rolls. The high-street bakery chain revealed a “next-level VIP” service for its celebrity fans, with Stormzy being the first member. The rapper said he had “peaked” when he unwrapped the VIP card, which allows him to order Greggs whenever and wherever he wants. He shared a video of him unboxing the gift on Twitter while en route to the airport for the European leg of his world tour. Are you mad the first Greggs black card @GreggsOfficial I have peaked this is brilliant 🤣 pic.twitter.com/lnoS71d1Y1 While Greggs has refused to disclose much about the special service, it said the membership to the private club was strictly invite-only. Nando’s has a similar “black card” that it sends to celebrities, allowing them to get meals for up to five people at any of their restaurants for free. Stormzy was handed the package on Thursday morning with a video from Greggs. It also sent him a pair of size-12 slippers after he made headlines for mistakenly wearing a pair to the BBC Breakfast TV show. A message inside the box reads: “Get those big size 12s on your feet. We’ll do the rest.” A Greggs spokesperson said: “Our concierge card is strictly by invite only to some of our biggest fans. That’s all we can say.”
