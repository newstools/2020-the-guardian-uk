Tyrell Robinson has been sacked by Bradford City after being charged with engaging in sexual activity with a child. The 22-year-old winger was initially arrested in August 2018 following allegations of sexual assault. In a statement on Monday, West Yorkshire Police said: “Tyrell Robinson, aged 22, of South Ockendon, Essex has been charged with engaging in penetrative sexual activity with a child. “The charge relates to an offence which is alleged to have occurred in Bradford in August 2018. He has also been charged with one count of making an indecent image of a child and two counts of distributing an indecent image of a child and has been summonsed to appear before Bradford magistrates on 7 April.” League Two Bradford, who had previously suspended Robinson, confirmed he had been sacked. A club statement said: “Bradford City Football Club has parted company with Tyrell Robinson. This comes after West Yorkshire Police confirmed charges had been brought against Robinson, following his arrest in August 2018. Robinson has been dismissed from the remainder of his contract on grounds of committing gross misconduct. The club will be making no further comment on the matter.”
