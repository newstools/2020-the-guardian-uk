“Football is nothing without fans,” said Jock Stein. Although not every fan contributes to the spectacle of football equally. Some go to matches and act in ways that would not be deemed acceptable anywhere else. They throw missiles, shout racist slurs, yell at referees, taunt players about their dead relatives, punch horses, throw banana skins and travel abroad to support their country and end up embarrassing their country. Spend long enough at a football match and you will see some supporters who are so pent up with anger, frustration and rage that you will be left wondering whether they enjoy the experience anymore or whether they would be better off doing something else with their Saturdays. We are often told that these fans are “a small minority” but is that your experience of going to football matches? Has the atmosphere changed over the last few years? Is it getting worse – or are we just more likely to take notice of the problems and report them? Perhaps you think the atmosphere is improving? Whatever your experience, we want to hear it. Are supporters mostly respectful and polite, or are an increasing number of fans becoming abusive and angry? Tell us in the form below.
