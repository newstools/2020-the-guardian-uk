Jürgen Klopp says he feels for Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City players after Liverpool’s closest rivals were handed a two-year ban from the Champions League. The Reds manager was speaking from a place of comfort after his side pulled 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League thanks to a 1-0 victory at Norwich thanks to a goal from substitute Sadio Mané. Uefa’s decision to ban City from European competition for contravening financial fair play and misleading European football’s governing body sent shockwaves across football on Friday. But while Klopp insisted he was not across the details of events off the field he showed solidarity with his fierce competitor on it. “It was a shock when I heard [the news]‚” Klopp said. “I saw the headline but I have no idea how these kind of things work, how [a punishment like City’s] happens. What I can say, as a football coach, is that under Pep Guardiola City play sensational football. I have always admired what they do and how they do it. “To be honest I feel for Pep and the players. Wow. They did, for sure, nothing wrong. They just played football and sensational football. Wherever Pep was he has helped each league to improve. But then in the end we all have to respect some rules and I have no idea if they did or not.” Klopp revealed that Mané had been fit to start against Norwich after returning from a hamstring injury but he had chosen to keep the Senegalese forward on the bench with Wednesday’s Champions League fixture against Atlético Madrid in mind. “Sadio could have started today, of course, but I wanted to have a free decision for Tuesday. I don’t think too often about these things but we had two players – Fabinho and Mané – coming back from injury and they should not play two games in a week, and the quality of the other boys is enough that you don’t have to push somebody through. “It was perfect for Sadio to get a few minutes today, but it looked like he was ready.”
