This underwater disaster flick, set on a deep-sea drilling rig, doesn’t even bother to disguise the fact that it’s essentially a subaqua version of Alien. But the inevitable comparisons do the film no favours – the dive bomb into immediate action means that the characters are barely sketched, giving us little to care about. Character archetypes are present and correct, with TJ Miller drawing the short straw as the brash, gum-chewing wild card who is destined for a particularly colourful close encounter. The murky cinematography further hinders a picture that looks as though it was shot through raw sewage.
