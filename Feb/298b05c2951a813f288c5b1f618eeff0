The first trailer for Wes Anderson’s new film, The French Dispatch, has been released online. Set in France, the film is a “love letter to journalists” that revolves around a New Yorker-style periodical edited by one Arthur Howitzer Jr (played by Bill Murray) and boasts Anderson’s usual gallery of big name cameos, including Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Benicio del Toro, Saoirse Ronan and Elisabeth Moss. The French Dispatch is due for release on 24 July in the US and 28 August in the UK.
