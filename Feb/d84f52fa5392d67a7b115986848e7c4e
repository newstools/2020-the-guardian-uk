Borussia Dortmund enjoyed dominant afternoon, demolishing Union Berlin 5-0 with two goals from Norwegian sensation Erling Haaland. Jadon Sancho opened their account in the 13th and teenager Haaland added another five minutes later. Dortmund scored twice more after the break with Marco Reus and Axel Witsel before Haaland drilled in his seventh goal in his three games for the Ruhr valley club so far since the Norwegian striker arrived from RB Salzburg last month. Bayern Munich fired in three goals in the opening 26 minutes to ease past hosts Mainz 05 3-1 on Saturday and go two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with their sixth straight league win. Top scorer Robert Lewandowski headed in his 22nd league goal in the eighth minute and Thomas Müller and Thiago Alcântara added two more to lift the Bavarians to 42 points. Mainz, who had cut the deficit on the stroke of halftime with Jeremiah St. Juste, rarely threatened the visitors. Florian Niederlechner struck for the 11th time this season to cancel Tin Jedvaj’s own goal which gave Werder Bremen the lead against Augsburg before Ruben Vargas completed the turnaround. Timothy Chandler secured a last-gasp point for Eintracht Frankfurt against Fortuna Düsseldorf, who had taken the lead through Kaan Ayhan. Hoffenheim came back from going behind to a Moussa Diaby goal to defeat Bayer Leverkusen at home. Andrej Kramaric restored parity and Robert Skov completed the turnaround. Things were made worse for Leverkusen who had Kerim Demirbay dismissed late on. In Serie A, Mattia Bani netted a 89th minute winner for Bologna against Brescia. Ernesto Torregrossa converted from the spot to put Brescia ahead but Riccardo Orsolini and Bani won it for the hosts.
