I ordered an iPhone 11 from Currys. My mother signed for the package delivered on 30 December. But when I opened the box, it was unsealed and the phone was missing. Just the charger and headphones were in the box. I called Currys, which said it needed to investigate and would contact me within 48 hours. After hearing nothing, I was told I had to wait seven days. A week later, still nothing. This time a very unhelpful member of staff said investigations actually took 14 days. A month on – despite many calls and emails on my part – I am no closer to receiving my phone. I have paid £699 for a box, charger and a set of headphones. CC, Hockley, Essex We have been getting a number of similar letters and want to warn anyone being sent expensive electronic items to check the item is actually present before you sign to say you received it. Mobile phones are increasingly sent out this way and couriers rarely want to hang around while you open the package, but if you don’t, you open yourself up to these kind of problems. Currys, which clearly could have managed this much better, has now apologised and offered you a full refund. It has also offered a discount on another phone. Make sure this one actually exists before signing for it. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number.
