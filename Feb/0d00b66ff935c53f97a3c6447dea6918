Rage Against the Machine, Stormzy and Liam Gallagher have been announced as the headliners for 2020’s Reading and Leeds festival. Rage Against the Machine’s sets are part of a newly announced 40-date world tour for the political rap-rockers, who are playing together for the first time since 2011. The tour includes two nights at New York’s Madison Square Garden, and seven dates across Europe. It comes after a short spring tour where they will perform gigs close to the US-Mexico border, as well as the Coachella festival in California. Stormzy’s Reading and Leeds sets come amid a major world tour, featuring 55 dates across five continents, and will be his first UK festival headline slots since his triumphant appearance at Glastonbury in 2019. Liam Gallagher was originally announced in November for the pair of festivals, which run simultaneously in both cities. Other rock and indie names include the Courteeners, Gerry Cinnamon, Two Door Cinema Club, Sam Fender and Idles, while rap is represented with Migos, AJ Tracey, D-Block Europe and Run the Jewels. Typically for the festivals, the top 13 announced artists are all male – Mabel, Mahalia and Beabadoobee are among the female names to have been announced further down the bill. Reading and Leeds takes place 28-30 August, with tickets going on sale at 9am on 13 February.
