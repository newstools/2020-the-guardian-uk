Porto striker Moussa Marega had to be restrained by teammates as he tried to walk off the pitch after he was apparently racially abused during his side’s 2-1 win over Vitoria de Guimarães. Marega scored what turned out to be the winner on the hour mark but felt unable to continue, his final act was to raise his two middle fingers to the home supporters. After scoring Porto’s second, Marega celebrated his goal by pointing to his skin. In response Vitoria fans aimed abuse and threw seats from the stand at Mali international. Marega even celebrated with one of the discarded plastic seats but then made his way to the side of the pitch, with his thumbs down and seemingly booing the home supporters. As Marega walked to the touchline, players from both teams attempted to calm down the striker and convince him to stay on the pitch but were unsuccessful. Porto head coach Sérgio Conceição also spoke to Marega but ultimately decided to grant him his wish of leaving the pitch and brought on Wilson Manafá to replace the goalscorer. After the match, Marega wrote on Instagram: “I would just like to tell these idiots who come to the stadium to make racist chants, go fuck yourself. I hope I never see you on a football field again. You are a disgrace! “And I also thank the referees for not defending me and for giving me a yellow card because I defend my skin colour.” Marega spent the 2016-17 season on loan at Vitoria, scoring 13 goals in 15 league appearances. Head coach Conceição said: “We are a family regardless of nationality, skin colour, hair colour. We are human, we deserve respect. What happened here is unfortunate,. “We are completely indignant with what happened. I know the passion that exists for Vitoria and I think that most of the fans do not see themselves (as having the same) attitude of some people who insulted Moussa since the warm-up.”
