Your article (Johnson to impose full customs checks on goods from EU, 1 February) gives cause for great concern – and not only for businesses. The article states that checks on all EU goods will be made as the goods pass through “border inspection posts”, adding that “businesses will be informed of the policy on 10 February”. That’s nice. But what about Northern Ireland? Where exactly are these “border inspection posts” going to be placed to examine goods travelling from Ireland to the UK via Northern Ireland? Will they be situated east-west on the Irish border or north-south on the Irish Sea? Or perhaps somewhere else altogether? The problem of the Irish border has been one of the most urgent and important questions raised by Brexit, yet it is one that the UK government has consistently failed to acknowledge and address. If there are plans to build customs inspection posts in Northern Ireland they should be made public without further delay.Harry ScottCoutras, France • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
