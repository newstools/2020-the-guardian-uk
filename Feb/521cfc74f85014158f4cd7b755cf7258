Eden Hazard will miss Real Madrid’s Champions League last-16 tie with Manchester City after suffering a broken ankle during Saturday’s La Liga defeat at Levante. The Belgian, who only recently returned from a three-month lay-off due to an ankle problem, was replaced in the second half of the 1-0 loss at the Ciutat de Valencia. Hazard underwent tests on the injury on Sunday morning, after which Madrid confirmed the extent of the problem. “Following the tests carried out today by the Real Madrid medical department, he has been diagnosed with a fracture to his right distal fibula,” read a club statement. “His recovery will continue to be assessed.” Madrid have not said how long they expect Hazard to be sidelined for but reports in Spain suggest he could be out for another two months. That would rule the former Chelsea player out of both Champions League matches against City, the first of which takes place at the Bernabéu on Wednesday. It would also see him miss next weekend’s clásico showdown against title rivals Barcelona, as well as a host of other matches for Zinedine Zidane’s men.
