The son of Liam Gallagher and the grandson of Ringo Starr have appeared in court to deny criminal charges over an alleged late-night altercation with staff in the branch of Tesco Express in Hampstead, London, last May. Gene Appleton Gallagher and Sonny Starkey, both 18, and a third defendant, Noah Ponte, 19, pleaded not guilty to affray, to using or threatening “unlawful violence towards another” and conducting themselves in a manner that would “cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety”. Ponte denied an additional charge of racially aggravated common assault. Gallagher, who is the youngest son of Oasis frontman Liam and All Saints singer Nicole Appleton, arrived at Highbury Corner magistrates court in London accompanied by his uncle, Liam Howlett of the Prodigy. Starkey arrived with his father Jason, whose father is former Beatle Ringo Starr. The three parties asked for the case to be sent to Wood Green crown court for trial. They were released on unconditional bail until the hearing on 9 March. Gallagher recently appeared on his father’s single, One of Us, and he has worked as a model for Adidas.
