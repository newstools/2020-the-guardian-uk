Heather Knight wants England to show their competitive mettle against Thailand at the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup on Wednesday. England were put on the back foot by defeat against South Africa in their opening match, making their second clash in Canberra hugely important. “Every game is must-win for us from now,” said Knight, the England captain. “It’s really important after the other night that we put in a really strong performance and come out fighting. “This team has shown a history of that. When we’ve had a bad performance and haven’t started so great, the way we’ve bounced back in the next game has been outstanding. We’re going to have to do that against Thailand.” A below-par batting performance cost them against South Africa, who won by six wickets. Knight does not believe there needs to be radical change, saying: “As players you have to be flexible and each ball can be really important, so we have to get used to that. “You have to be open-minded, to park the ego sometimes and know the job you’re doing is right for the team. We haven’t lost clarity, we just had a bad day and we’re looking to put it right.”
