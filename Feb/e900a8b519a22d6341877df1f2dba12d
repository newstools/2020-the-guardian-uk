Malt loaf is well known to cyclists as a perfect high-carb, low-fat snack. It’s a mystery to me that people love plums, but deride prunes. They are fantastic and shine in this recipe. The sugar and dried fruit provide a speedy dose of energy, but you also get slow-release carbohydrates from the sweet potato that are perfect for endurance. This loaf works just as well at home – toasted, buttered and partnered with a cup of tea. Makes one 20cm loaf 150g prunes100g sweet potato150g malt extract100ml prune juice50g soft brown sugar50g dark muscovado sugar50g porridge oats70g strong white bread flour140g plain flour¼ tsp salt1½ tsp baking powder2 large eggsMaple syrup to brush on top once cooked Line a 20cm loaf tin with baking paper. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4. Chop the prunes into quarters and set aside. Grate the sweet potato finely and set aside. In a saucepan, gently heat the malt extract, prune juice and sugar until dissolved. Whiz the oats to a powder in a blender, then combine in a mixing bowl with the flour, salt and baking powder. Pour in the sweet mixture and mix, then beat in the eggs. Finally, add the dried fruit and sweet potato and mix together well. Transfer to the loaf tin and bake for one hour. Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the tin before turning out on to a wire rack and brushing with maple syrup. This is a sticky loaf, so my tip is to slice it with a sharp breadknife once cool.
