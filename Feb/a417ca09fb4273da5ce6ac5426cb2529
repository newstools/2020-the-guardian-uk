Castleford have devised a plan to see how Israel Folau copes on his return to rugby league after the controversial Australian moved a step closer to his Super League debut. Folau is set to make his first appearance for Catalans Dragons on Saturday after being named in a 21-man squad for the game in Perpignan. Folau was deemed not ready to play in last Sunday’s match at Wakefield, which was postponed because of Storm Ciara. He had arrived in the south of France only days before. The Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, said they had done their homework on a player who has not played league for nearly a decade. “We’ve got to try to make him rusty,” he said. “He’s a big, athletic player and he’s similar to Sonny Bill Williams in that there’s a bit of an unknown there. We’ve watched a lot of footage of him and we’re aware of that right-foot step of his, which is really dominant.” Folau could still technically not play against Castleford, with four players from the Catalans squad dropping out before kick-off. The Dragons are short on outside-backs because of injuries and with Folau likely to resume his league career in the centres – where he made his name in the sport with Melbourne and Brisbane – it makes the prospect of him playing all-but guaranteed. “I think he will play,” Powell said. “There’s a bit of an unknown there but plans aren’t going to change too much. We think we know the way he’s going to play. We’re not specifically putting him under pressure but we have looked at him and how him coming in will impact them. “We’ve got some smart centres and it’ll be interesting to see what they throw up out on the edges. Catalans haven’t got into a groove, so it’s hard to work them out. He hasn’t played rugby league for 10 years, so we want to see if he’s still any good at it.” 🏉 21 MAN SQUADSteve McNamara a dévoilé le groupe pour la réception de @CTRLFC💥 Israel Folau fera ses débuts samedi sous le maillot catalan🇫🇷 https://t.co/ZWPVOgbUoA🇬🇧 https://t.co/DwNkhbUjvu#Dragons 🐉 pic.twitter.com/HEELd5Ygml Folau, who was sacked by Rugby Australia last year following homophobic comments on social media, continues to dominate headlines two weeks on from the announcement he was returning to league. The Rugby Football League and Super League have admitted that despite calls from many clubs for Folau’s registration to be rejected, they were powerless to prevent him from signing for Catalans. Super League clubs last week agreed tighter measures to prevent controversial signings joining the competition.
