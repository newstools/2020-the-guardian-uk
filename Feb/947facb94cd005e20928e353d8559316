The Mazzy Star co-founder and multi-instrumentalist David Roback has died, a representative for the band announced Tuesday. He was 61. A cause of death has not yet been released. A producer, guitarist and keyboardist, Roback formed Mazzy Star alongside Hope Sandoval. The pair would go on to write all of the group’s songs. Roback played a leading role in the neo-psychedelic revival of the 1980s and ’90s, the Los Angeles Times reports, helping found Rain Parade, a band central to LA’s “paisley underground” scene of the early ’80s. After forming Mazzy Star in Santa Monica in 1989, the group landed their biggest hit in 1994 with Fade Into You, a song that hit No 44 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and whose gauzy sound became emblematic of the era. Mazzy Star released three critically acclaimed albums between 1990 and 1996, creating a sonic signature Rolling Stone described as a blend of “dream pop, psychedelia and touches of blues and folk with some of the blown-out textures of nineties alt-rock”. After 1997, the group stayed mostly quiet for 14 years until 2011, when it released a new single, and in 2013, a fourth album, Seasons of Your Day. Sandoval and Roback told Rolling Stone  they had spent the years in between albums writing and recording but not performing or releasing music. “When I’m working on music with Hope, the person that’s foremost in my thoughts is Hope,” Roback told the music magazine. “We tend to get quite caught up in just the making of music for ourselves.”
