Following the sacking of Claire O’Neill as president of the forthcoming climate change talks in Glasgow, and her subsequent criticism of Boris Johnson (COP 26: Cameron was asked by PM to take over – but he said no, 5 February), I would suggest that the only UK politician of sufficient integrity, dedication and expert knowledge on the subject of climate change to take over is Caroline Lucas MP.Rose HarvieDumbarton • I wonder what the government will do to replace the huge tax receipts lost when petrol and diesel vehicles are banned. Answers on the back of an electricity bill, please.Ian MetcalfePerth • No, Larry Elliott is not the only economist who believes the UK to be better off (in the long term) outside the EU (Letters, 3 February). One of the others is Prof Bill Mitchell, of Newcastle University, Australia. Prof Mitchell is speaking in London on 20 February, so why not come along and ask him to explain his viewpoint?Mike EllwoodAbingdon, Oxfordshire • May I, a 95-year-old, second-generation Guardian reader, join the marmalade marathon (Letters, 5 February). This year I have made 6lb of grapefruit marmalade and 20lb of Seville orange. I hope to live to enjoy it all!Joy NalpanisReading, Berkshire • I have never made marmalade. But I still do create jams/chutneys for my friends.
