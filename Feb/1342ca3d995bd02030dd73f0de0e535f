The Metropolitan police commissioner has defended the surveillance operation that was tailing Sudesh Amman when he stabbed two people in broad daylight on a busy street in south London at the weekend. Amman, 20, had been released from prison 10 days before he carried out the Streatham attack, having served time for terrorism offences. Wearing a fake suicide belt, he stole a knife from a shop on Streatham High Road and stabbed two bystanders. He was shot dead by officers within 60 seconds. Asked by London assembly members how Amman was able to carry out the attack with “reportedly 20 officers” watching him, Cressida Dick said: “Surveillance officers are sometimes armed, sometimes not. They’re highly trained. “They’re armed when it’s believed they may need to defend themselves against a particularly high level of threat. They’re conducting covert surveillance. They’re not providing man-to-man marking.” She added: “It is inevitable that there could be a time delay before somebody totally unexpectedly does something.” Dick said it was not possible for the police to prevent every attack. “I wish I could assure the public that everybody who poses a risk on the streets could be subject to some sort of thing that would stop them being able to stab anybody ever, but it is clearly not possible,” she said. Amman was jailed for three years and four months in December 2018 for possessing and distributing terrorist documents. He was freed automatically halfway through his sentence and put under 24-hour police surveillance. Sources have said he was an “extremely concerning individual”. Dick said a team of 75 officers were working to gather evidence for the coroner about Amman’s attack. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating how he came to be fatally shot, as is standard when any police operation ends in a death.
