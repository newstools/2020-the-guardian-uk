As medical practitioners increasingly recognise the importance of autonomy and include the public in the planning and delivery of healthcare, it has become vital to listen to and engage with patients’ wishes. Yet, when it comes to assisted dying, we have become out of step. In 2006, the British Medical Association moved to oppose assisted dying. Even back then, polls indicated considerable public support for assisted dying, and people rarely travelled abroad to end their life. But in the years since, public support for a change in the law has risen to around 90%. Despite the best efforts of palliative care, at least one UK citizen a week is forced to leave their home and travel to Switzerland to have an assisted death – which at best is a decision fraught with emotional and financial cost, and at worst involves someone ending their life before they would otherwise wish. It is time for change. Over 150 million people worldwide have gained the option of a safeguarded assisted death, as more countries, including Canada, have changed their laws. If other countries can achieve this in a safe and legal manner, why can’t we? The BMA’s survey on assisted dying closes this Thursday. We urge members to vote in support of reform.
