Christian Eriksen says his decision to run down his contract made him a “black sheep” at Tottenham. The 27-year-old midfielder joined Internazionale last week for £17m. The Dane would have been out of contract in the summer and had been linked with a move away since last summer, when he revealed he was ready for a new challenge in the wake of Spurs’ Champions League final defeat. “England, for the last few years, was very hectic,” Eriksen told BBC Sport. “After what I said in the summer, it was just about: ‘When is he going to leave?’ Every game it was: ‘Is he leaving? Is he not leaving?’ Of course a lot of people were speaking about it. “Even the fans you see on the street were like: ‘Thank you, goodbye and good luck.’ But I was still there. It was a bit weird. In my head and for my body, it is good that I am in a new place and I can start again.” Eriksen added: “I wouldn’t say it affected me. In England, when your contract is shorter, it is like you have to leave now. You are gone. In the end I played about 30 games that were like goodbye games. “If you have a short contract, you will be the black sheep. Of course, I did the interview. I was very honest. I felt I had to be honest.

I read I was the bad person in the changing room, that ever since I said I wanted to leave, it was no good me being there.”
