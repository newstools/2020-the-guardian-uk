Have fun and be patientOnline classes can be done at home without the pressure of being in a big class – so have fun! Rewind as much as you need to get the choreography and movement right, and don’t take yourself too seriously. It’s a learning process: you won’t see immediate results. Make it a dateBecause online classes are done anywhere, there isn’t as much accountability to take classes regularly, so have a friend come over and learn together. At the end of the day, dancing is most fun with other people! Keep it upThe best way to get the most out of a choreo class is to take it more than one time: just because you took it once, it doesn’t mean you mastered it. It can take multiple run-throughs to understand the movements and build muscle memory. Get to know the choreo so well that you could perform it without looking at the screen. (PS: look at yourself in a mirror. Don’t be shy – you’ll immediately see what needs to improve.) • Choreographer and dancer Sarah Eika Burke is on YouTube  and saraheikaburke.weebly.com.
