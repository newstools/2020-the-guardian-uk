I’m often asked what my favourite cake is. Interminably indecisive as I am, I can never think of an answer (see also ‘what’s your favourite book, film or episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?’), but toscakaka would definitely be in the running. If you’ve never tried this Swedish classic, think of a rich, buttery cake with a topping of toasted almonds and caramel. It’s a bit like baking a giant florentine on to a cake, which is every bit as delicious as it sounds. This version also includes a little grated marzipan to the caramel for extra almondy chewiness.

Heat the oven to 170C (160C fan)/gas 4. To make the cake, cream the butter and sugar, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Pour into the tin and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping. Melt together the butter, sugar and marzipan in a saucepan over a low heat. Take the pan off the heat, add the cream, flour and almonds, and mix. Once the cake is ready, remove from the oven and turn the heat up to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6. Pour the topping over the cake, ensuring it covers the surface, then return to the oven for six to eight minutes, until golden. Set aside to cool, then remove from the tin. Dust with icing sugar just before serving.
