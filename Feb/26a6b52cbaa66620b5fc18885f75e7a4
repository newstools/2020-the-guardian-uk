Bury AFC, the phoenix club launched after Bury’s expulsion from the Football League, will begin life next season in the 10th tier of the English pyramid. The North West Counties Football League has approved an application from Bury AFC for them to join the league next season. Bury were expelled from the Football League last August after failing to secure new ownership when a last-minute takeover bid collapsed. The original club appear to be heading for liquidation after the owner, Steve Dale, defaulted on the company voluntary arrangement (CVA) he agreed last summer to settle Bury’s £5m debts, having failed to provide the money required to fund them. On Friday, the NWCFL confirmed that 11 clubs had applied for promotion to Step 6 (the ninth and 10th tiers) providing they meet the ground grade H criteria by 31 March. Nine of those clubs must finish in the top five of their respective Step 7 competitions. However the new clubs Bury AFC and FC Isle of Man have been listed for inclusion to join the league. A message posted on Bury AFC’s Twitter account read: “Bury AFC are listed below for inclusion (to the) North West Counties Football League for 2020/21. This confirms our belief that we are the only team currently with an application in to play football in Bury next season. BRING. IT. ON.”
