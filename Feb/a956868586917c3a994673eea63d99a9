Tracy Brabin has announced that she is auctioning the off-the-shoulder dress that drew criticism after she wore it in the Commons. The Labour MP was forced to defend her attire after the dress slipped off her shoulder when she leaned on the despatch box due to a broken ankle on Tuesday. Brabin has since decided to sell the dress for charity on eBay, claiming it had sold out on ASOS, the fashion website, as a result of the coverage. “Black dress worn by Tracy Brabin MP in ‘shouldergate’ as widely covered across the media,” the listing read. “This is an ASOS dress which has been flying off the shelves as a result of the coverage – and is now sold out!” “All money raised will go to Girlguiding UK to support their work helping girls build confidence and self-esteem, in the hope that they grow up to be leaders,” the listing continued. Brabin responded to criticism of her attire on social media earlier in the week: Hello.
