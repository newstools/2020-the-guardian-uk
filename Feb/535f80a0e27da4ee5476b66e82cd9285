A maiden one-day international century for Heinrich Klaasen helped South Africa to a 74-run win over Australia in the opening match of a at Paarl.Klaasen hit an unbeaten 123 from 114 balls as the home side recovered from a poor start to rack up 291 for seven from their 50 overs. That proved to be more than good enough, with Australia bowled out for 217 inside 46 overs. Kyle Verreynne and Janneman Malan both made their one-day debuts for South Africa, and experienced differing fortunes. Malan was adjudged lbw to Mitchell Starc on review off the first ball of the innings but Verreynne hit a valuable 48 to help the Proteas recover from a position of 48 for three. Verreynne and Klaasen put on 78 for the fourth wicket, and David Miller then added 149 with the centurion before falling for 64. Australia made a positive start and were 133 when Marnus Labuschagne became the third man to fall. But the wicket of Steve Smith for 76 left the tourists on 174 for five and wickets fell frequently thereafter. Lungi Ngidi was the pick of the South Africa bowlers with three for 30 from his eight overs. The second match of a series of three takes place on Wednesday in Bloemfontein.
