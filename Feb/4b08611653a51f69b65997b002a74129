José Mourinho says finishing in the top four with Tottenham would be his greatest achievement given an injury crisis he thinks is the worst in Europe. The manager previously claimed that finishing second in the Premier League with Manchester United in 2018 was his best feat. He is being forced to play the remaining quarter of the season without a recognised striker because Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, who has undergone successful surgery on a broken arm, are injured. “In these circumstances, yes,” Mourinho said when asked whether finishing top-four would out-rank his second place with United. “We have to face that. Again I repeat the boys did fantastic to put themselves back in the positions where we belong; these positions fighting for the top four. “The situation is difficult. I think nobody else in the Premier League for sure, but even in European football, is in such a difficult situation as we are in terms of injuries in specific positions. “Sonny and Harry, they score the majority of goals that Tottenham score. This season was so negatively special that we’ll be without them both at the same time for a lot of matches. “So yes, not for me, my achievement, but collectively for this group of boys if we manage to finish fourth without Harry and Sonny it would be something incredible, incredible achievement for the boys.” Tottenham, who play at Chelsea on Saturday, had some better injury news with Moussa Sissoko training on grass again after a knee operation. Mourinho expects the midfielder to be back for the end of March.
