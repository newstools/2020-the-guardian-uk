Any human branded “a jerk” on social media would rightly take offence. But Perdita, officially the “world’s worst cat” according to animal shelter officials in North Carolina who were trying to re-home the grumpy kitty, wore it as a badge of honour. On Saturday, as a result of one of the greatest cat rescue marketing ploys of all time, Perdita found herself on her way to a “forever home” in Tennessee. She went with a new name, Noel, but also with the same testy demeanour that made her a viral sensation in the first place, with more than 10,000 Facebook likes and her own hashtag of #worldsworstcat. In its latest post on the social media platform, the Mitchell county animal rescue group of Spruce Pine announced the “bittersweet” news that Perdita/Noel had found new owners identified only as Joe and Betty from Monroe county. “They adore her and she tolerates them,” the post said, explaining that the stroppy cat refused to pose for the traditional adoption photograph and instead ran from the room growling. The group said it had received 175 applications to adopt Perdita since introducing her to the world 10 days ago with descriptions of challenging behaviours including “lurking in dark corners” and “staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never feel cheerful again”. With dislikes said to include Disney movies, kittens and the colour pink, the cat was also described as a master of deception. “We thought she was sick,” the post said. “Turns out she’s just a jerk.” The rescue group hopes to capitalise on the publicity by finding homes for other animals in its care, including Edgar, a rotund orange tabby who shares an affinity for “reaching out and touching someone”. Perdita’s internet stardom looks set to continue, with an Instagram account set up to chronicle the next chapter in the life of the fractious feline.
