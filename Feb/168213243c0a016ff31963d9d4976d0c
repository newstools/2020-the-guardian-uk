England maintained their push for a second successive Women’s Six Nations grand slam by beating Scotland 53-0 in Edinburgh. The match was switched to Murrayfield and played behind closed doors following the postponement in Glasgow on Sunday because of Storm Ciara. And England made up for lost time by moving top of the table above Ireland on points difference, setting up a key encounter between the countries later this month. Sarah Hunter’s team followed their 80-0 victory against the Scots last season by running in eight tries as snow fell in the Scottish capital, including doubles for the full-back Emily Scott and the wing Abby Dow. Hunter, the prop Sarah Bern, the wing Jess Breach and the substitute Claudia MacDonald also crossed, while the centre Emily Scarratt kicked five conversions and a penalty. Scarratt’s 13-point haul meant she overtook her teammate Katy Daley-McLean as England Women’s all-time leading scorer.
