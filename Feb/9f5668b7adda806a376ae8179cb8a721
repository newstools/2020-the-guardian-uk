A former NFL player has won the Oscar for best animated short film eight years after predicting he would one day be nominated. Matthew A Cherry wrote and directed Hair Love and won the award along with producer Karen Rupert Toliver. On Sunday night one of his tweets from 2012 resurfaced in which he wrote “I’m gonna be nominated for an Oscar one day. Already claiming it.” Hair Love tells the story of an African American father attempting to do his daughter’s hair for the first time. Cherry said he hoped his award would usher in “more representation in animation” and “normalise black hair”. Cherry’s guest for the evening was Deandre Arnold, a Texas high school student who was told he couldn’t attend his graduation ceremony unless he cut his dreadlocks. “It means the world to us to have him here with us,” Cherry said. “We wanted people to see how good of a kid he is, but also there’s no reason people should be policing our hair.” Cherry was a star college wide receiver at Akron before a three-year career in the NFL, which included time with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens. He used a $30,000 injury settlement from the Ravens to kickstart his entertainment career and he is now a TV director and has worked with the likes of Jordan Peele and Ava DuVernay. I'm gonna be nominated for an Oscar one day. Already claiming it “I really didn’t even tell people I played ball,” he told the Undefeated last year when discussing his entry into the television industry. “Athletes are always looked at weirdly when they try to do something outside of what they’ve been known for, and I was always conscious of that.” Cherry is the second former athlete in three years to win the Oscar for best animated short. The late Kobe Bryant claimed the award for his film, Dear Basketball, at the 2018 ceremony. Cherry dedicated his award to Bryant, who died last month in a helicopter crash.
