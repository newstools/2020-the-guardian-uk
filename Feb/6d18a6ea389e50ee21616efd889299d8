I’m very glad that Jane McAdoo remembers the Great Guardian Diary Loofahs from all those years ago (Letters, 4 February). I still have them: one skinned, one unskinned. They don’t get a lot of use now but are often admired. Until the seeds finally worked their way out, the unskinned one was also a handy rattle/baby distracter. My wife and I have interrupted our marmalade-making to send this.Martin Wainwright(Guardian Diary editor in the good old loofah days) Thrupp, Oxfordshire • Last week I went to the local library to borrow Made in Scotland by Billy Connolly. Not finding it in the biography section, a helpful librarian thought it might be under comedy, but it was not. She eventually located the book in the foreign travel section. A sign of things to come?Sarah RennieRedditch, Worcestershire • I am sorry to tell Patti Whaley (Letters, 5 February) that her “properly-hyphenated” adjectives are not properly hyphenated. “Properly” is an adverb and as such doesn’t need hyphenating to the adjective it is describing.Richard TowersSheffield • The key to understanding Boris Johnson (Journal, 4 February) is to take his words literally. “Incredible” and “fantastic” mean just what they say: unbelievable fantasies. Rodney Smith Chapelton, Aberdeenshire • On 5 February, in the Yorkshire Pennines, the crocuses were in full flower; not so many years ago we would have still been under snow.Graeme Innes-JohnstoneElland, West Yorkshire • Atrophied (Wordwheel, G2, 4 February)?
