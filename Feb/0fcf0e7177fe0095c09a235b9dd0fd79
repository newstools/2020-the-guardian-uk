The headmaster of St Kevin’s college in Melbourne has resigned after it was revealed he wrote a character reference for a school’s athletic coach after he was convicted of grooming a student. In a letter to parents, headmaster Stephen Russell said he would resign immediately for the well-being of the school and students. “I have a deep and abiding passion for this school community and am very grateful for the 24 years of nurturing I and my family have received,” he said in the letter. Former coach Peter Kehoe was convicted in 2015 for grooming then year 9 student Paris Street. According to the ABC when Kehoe was coaching Street, he sent him messages via Facebook which eventually escalated to the coach taking Street to his house and inviting him into his bed. Russell and the school’s dean of sport, Luke Travers, came under fire after the ABC’s Four Corners program revealed Russell had provided a reference to Kehoe during sentencing, and Travers had provided a character reference before the trial.
