A man has been charged over Thursday’s stabbing attack at London Central Mosque. Daniel Horton, 29, of no fixed address, was charged on Friday night with grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article, Scotland Yard said. He will appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on Saturday. Raafat Maglad, who is in his 70s, was treated in hospital for stab injuries after Thursday’s incident but was later released. The Muslim prayer leader returned to the mosque in Regent’s Park for Friday prayers, less than 24 hours after the incident.
