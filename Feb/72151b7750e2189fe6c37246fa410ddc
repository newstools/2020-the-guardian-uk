Gene editing is a group of technologies that gives scientists the ability to change an organism’s DNA. These technologies have the power to change life as we know it, but what do people really think about how we should use them? Gene editing could be one of the most interesting and relevant scientific stories of our generation. This new technology could affect everything from food to healthcare to our attempts to tackle climate change. However, there are ethical issues to consider, such as who has the power to decide what should happen next and how can the science be policed? Will gene editing benefit the whole of society or only those who can afford it? And how far is too far? Is it right to use the technology to overcome genetic issues but not to decide the colour of a baby’s eyes?
