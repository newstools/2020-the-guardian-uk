We represent a growing number of evangelical Christians who are unwilling to support mission events led by the American evangelist Franklin Graham (Second venue scraps event by US evangelical preacher Graham, 30 January). We find it hard to reconcile his public and partisan statements on such issues as immigration, poverty, gun control and Israel with our understanding of the teaching and values of Jesus Christ. At this time when the political polarisation in the UK is intense, the Graham tour is unlikely to help the cause of national reconciliation. Instead we fear that his activities in the UK will widen divides in churches and communities. It seems likely to us that people will be driven further away from Jesus rather than brought to faith through hearing his presentation of the gospel. His father, Billy Graham, made numerous visits to the UK between the 1950s and the 1990s, but only in response to broad-based invitations from British churches. No such invitation exists for Franklin Graham. We uphold the right of everyone to freedom of speech and religion, and do not support calls to ban or silence Graham. However, we hope that fellow evangelicals will withdraw their support, and that Franklin Graham and his associates will abandon their plans for the tour.Canon Peter Adams LutonArkle Bell CardiffRev Sarah Bingham WalsallRev Rich Blake-Lobb LondonArfon Jones CardiffRev Simon Jones LondonPaul Keeble ManchesterCarol Kingston-Smith TewkesburyJon Kuhrt Streatham, LondonRev Paul Lavender Churches Together in NorthamptonRev Dr Sally Mann East LondonRev Glen Marshall ManchesterRev John Oliver BournemouthGreg Smith PrestonDr Justin Thacker ChesterfieldRev Bev Thomas West MidlandsRev Steve Weatherly-Barton Spalding • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
