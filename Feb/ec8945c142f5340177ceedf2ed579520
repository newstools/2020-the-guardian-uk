Allianz is to finish its sponsorship of Saracens and their Hendon stadium at the end of the season. The German insurance group has backed the club since 2012, sponsoring the kit as well as holding naming rights to the ground, and was set to continue until 2021. However with Saracens preparing for life in the Championship after accepting relegation from the Premiership for repeated salary cap breaches, the club’s commercial partner has decided to cut its association short. The European champions are reported to have been paid £2m a year as part of the agreement with Allianz. “Allianz has taken the difficult decision to end its sponsorship of Saracens Rugby Club and stadium at the end of this season,” a company statement said. “Allianz intends to continue to be involved in the great work that the Saracens Sports Foundation does in their local community and wishes Saracens well in the future.” In November Saracens were fined £5.36m after repeated salary cap breaches and last month were handed another points deduction, with their relegation from the top tier also confirmed. This month Saracens were fined €50,000 (£42,500) – half of which was suspended – for fielding an ineligible player, the prop Titi Lamositele, in their Champions Cup win over Racing 92. They were not deducted any points over the incident, however, which would have resulted in them exiting the competition. Saracens said they would seek to develop “new commercial partnerships in the coming months”.
