If you were just judging this film by its cast (a mix of EastEnders and Casualty alumni and barely knowns, with Craig Fairbrass in the lead), its cheesy marketing materials, and the barebones pitch (ex-con tries to go straight but is dragged down by his shiftless brother), hopes would not be high for this British crime thriller. Indeed, with its downbeat narrative trajectory, substantial helpings of violence, and high frequency use of the naughtiest of swearwords, this certainly feels like another outer-borough-set wodge of slicey-dicey post-pub entertainment. But sometimes a seemingly unprepossessing genre film comes along that has finer qualities than you would expect. Such is the case here. Directed by former actor Philip Barantini and written by Greg Hall and George Russo (who also co-stars as the seedy brother), this has refined touches throughout, starting with the slightly distorted sound design and brooding, unsettling score by Aaron May and David Ridley. Fine use is made of Fairbrass as ex-con Eddie, an actor who makes up with charisma and commitment what he might lack in range. He’s been playing these sort of hard men for donkey’s years, but recently he’s started bringing different colours to his palette. In this case, it’s a mournful fatalism; in the recent feature Muscle, it was an unexpected strain of sleaziness and carnality. He used to be the poor casting director’s Vinnie Jones, but he’s proving to be a more interesting, versatile performer with every feature. On the downside, genre cliches are sprinkled throughout, and the female parts are poorly written. Nevertheless, Izuka Hoyle impresses as Eddie’s estranged daughter who really lets rip with the emoting in the final minutes; and Eloise Lovell Anderson manages to make something of her role as a drug-addled stripper girlfriend. • Villain is released in the UK on 28 February.
