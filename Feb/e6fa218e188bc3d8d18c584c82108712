Mention of Tamara Rojo’s 2013 and 2016 comments on the then rarity of ballets choreographed by females (Women take centre stage for year at ballet company, 1 February) didn’t note in discussing Royal New Zealand Ballet’s upcoming all-female choreographic year that in April 2016 the English National Ballet’s artistic director turned comment into action: three one-act ballets, all choreographed by women, debuted at Sadler’s Wells under the overall title She Said. The programme’s success was replicated there in April 2019 with She Persisted, a programme of three one-act ballets choreographed by females, which included ENB first artist Stina Quagebeur’s ballet Nora, her first work for main-stage production. Rojo also plans to choreograph a version of the Russian ballet Raymonda later this year.
