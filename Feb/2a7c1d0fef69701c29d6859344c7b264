At Sunday night’s Baftas, film stars, royals and the viewing public were reminded that the Syrian people should not be forgotten – as airstrikes and barrel bombs still rain down on Idlib province, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee (Report, 4 February). As she accepted the award for best documentary, the director and narrator of For Sama, Waad Al-Kateab, told the world that the “people of Idlib should hear your voice now”. Al-Kateab’s plea for support for Syrians trapped in Idlib brought many viewers, including me, to tears. But Syrians need more than tears: they need action. The international community must put more pressure on all parties to end the unrelenting attacks on civilians and hospitals, and move towards an urgent and sustainable ceasefire. The future will remain bleak for the millions of families struggling to survive unless a political process is brokered to address the underlying causes of this conflict.Hombeline Dulière Syria crisis emergency programme manager, Cafod • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
