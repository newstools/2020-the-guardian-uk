We’d like to understand more about how people think. We want to find out what having ‘an inner voice’ means to different people. We’re interested in the many ways people express their thoughts whether that be an internal monologue or something more abstract like sounds, shapes and colours rather than simply a singular voice. We are interested in hearing in detail from people about the ways in which they think. How do you express your thoughts internally? Do you see, feel or hear anything at all? If so, what happens inside your head? If you don’t have an inner voice, how does that feel and how do you communicate your thoughts to yourself? You can get in touch by filling in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you wish. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information.
