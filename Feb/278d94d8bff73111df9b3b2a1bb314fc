Someone new has just started in my office. We are going to be working closely together. He is really lovely, but he has very bad BO. The other day I had to shift away from him during a meeting because the smell was making me gag. I’m worried if I tell him it will make things awkward and I don’t want to upset him. Do I talk to him or try to sit as far from him as possible? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
