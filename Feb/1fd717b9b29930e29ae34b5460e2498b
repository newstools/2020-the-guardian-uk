“We still have our president, since Trump got acquitted in his impeachment trial, and now he’s ready for revenge on anyone he believes wronged him,” said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show as he debuted a new segment: The Trump Ire Strikes Back. On Friday, Donald Trump “proved he’s more spite than man” when he fired two critical impeachment witnesses: Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the EU, and Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the national security council. The dismissals show that “Trump has gone full strongman”, said Colbert. “He’s making a list of enemies and he’s changed the name of his resort to Mar-a-Gulago.” Trump also “proved that revenge is a dish best served stupid”, said Colbert, by firing Vindman’s twin brother, an army lieutenant colonel who worked as a lawyer on the national security council. “Oh, it’s always been my fantasy to fire twins,” joked Colbert. With the firings, Trump overruled the advice of a “handful” of Republican senators who urged him not to dismiss any impeachment witnesses. “How dumb are these senators?” Colbert asked. “You voted not to do the one thing that could’ve taken him down. That’s like saying, ‘Now that we’ve gotten rid of all the town’s silver bullets, that werewolf will really listen to us. Sit, werewolf, sit.’” On Monday, Trump met with several state governors and discussed Nato, which he described as “going down like a rocket ship”. “Oh yeah, that thing that famously goes down: a rocket ship,” Colbert deadpanned. “This is the man who wants to start space force – before we launch any of those rockets into space, let’s make sure they’re pointed in the right direction.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah waded into the increasingly contentious Democratic primary race, in which Pete Buttigieg, “former South Bend mayor and human ventriloquist dummy”, has surged in the polls. Biden claims that Buttigieg’s leadership has been a dog and pony show, then calls a voter a “lying dog-faced pony soldier.” 🤔 pic.twitter.com/RU1JlejrLQ After a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg is tied with Bernie Sanders in several polls forecasting Tuesday’s primary in New Hampshire. But “if Pete Buttigieg is on the rise, Joe Biden is on the ropes”, said Noah. “From being the clear frontrunner just a couple weeks ago, he’s now struggling to stay relevant in the polls. Which is why the former VP is going after Buttigieg harder than anyone.” Noah played a recent ad in which Biden’s campaign lampooned Buttigieg’s political experience, contrasting the mayor’s placement of colored lights on South Bend’s bridges with Biden’s role in passing the Affordable Care Act. Noah called the ad “bitchy” but understood why Biden attacked Buttigieg’s lack of experience. Still, “to me, experience doesn’t matter any more when it comes to being president of the United States”, he said. “If there’s one thing Donald Trump has shown America, it’s – well, how not to apply makeup – but if there’s another thing he’s shown America, it’s that you can run this country without experience. “I know it sounds crazy, but if you think about it, none of the shitty things Trump has done were because he didn’t have experience,” Noah concluded. “They’re because he’s a dick. Which is ironically the one thing where he has decades of experience.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers assessed the fallout from the end of Trump’s impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted by what Meyers called a “Republican Senate which locked arms to acquit him at all costs, refusing to hear witnesses or new bombshell evidence and rushing through a sham impeachment trial to dismiss the charges as quickly as possible. “Clearly, he’s been celebrating by not just getting some sun, but all of it,” Meyers said over a viral photo of Trump’s hair blowing in the wind, revealing a stark fake tan ending abruptly at his hairline. “He looks just like he went to the beach wearing a dog cone,” Meyers said. “Trump only cares about the top 1%, even when he’s applying sunscreen to his face. Looks like he stuck his face in an empty bag of Doritos and sucked up the dust.” Meyers also addressed Trump’s firing of Vindman as revenge for testifying in the impeachment trial, though Trump told reporters it was just because he was not “happy” with Vindman. Meyers wasn’t buying it. “First of all, no one expects you to be happy with him because you’re never happy, period,” he said. “You’ve lived the most charmed life of any human being on the planet and yet you’re constantly scowling. Your face only has two modes: angry scowl, or meatloaf that’s been in the oven too long.” More importantly, Meyers said, “it doesn’t matter if you’re happy with him or not – he did his duty and told the truth. Your feelings are irrelevant.”
