A homeless man has appeared in court charged with stabbing a prayer leader with a kitchen knife at a London mosque. Daniel Horton, 29, is accused of grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article. He appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday. Horton spoke only to state his nationality as British and confirm his name and date of birth. Raafat Maglad, 70, was treated in hospital for stab injuries after being injured at London Central mosque in Regent’s Park on Thursday. Maglad, known as the muezzin – the person who makes the call to prayer – returned to the mosque for Friday prayers less than 24 hours after the incident. The prosecutor, Tanyia Dogra, said Maglad suffered a 1.5cm wound to his neck. She told the court the victim and defendant were known to each other because Horton had been attending the mosque for a number of years. Horton, who the court heard had been sleeping rough since last year, was remanded in custody to appear at Southwark crown court on 20 March.
