The measured and appreciative obituary of George Steiner described the fascinating stage adaptation by Christopher Hampton of Steiner’s novella The Portage to San Cristobal of AH as a one-man show for Alec McCowen. However, outstanding as his performance was, he was but one of an ensemble of fine actors. In the story Hitler is transported from his Amazon jungle hideaway by Jewish mercenaries. Letting him speak will risk persuading others that he had a case and adverse circumstances compel them to mount a trial in the jungle before he can reach a wider audience. Hitler has the stage to himself and for the final 20 minutes is given the chance to prove Steiner’s point. It was a play about the power of language, here the words of an “orator”, to persuade you that even reprehensible immorality can be justified. It would merit revival.
