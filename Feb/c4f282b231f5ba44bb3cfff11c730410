Simon Jenkins is absolutely right, as usual – this time about the folly that is HS2 (Does HS2 ‘level up’ the north? Don’t be duped, Journal, 15 February). But it won’t be necessary for people arriving from Birmingham en route to the continent to “wheel their suitcases down the Euston Road” from Euston station to St Pancras.
