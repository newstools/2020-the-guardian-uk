Anyone banned for violent or abusive behaviour by a Premier League club will also be banned from every other ground in the division, the league announced on Thursday. The punishment was agreed unanimously at a meeting of Premier League clubs in central London. The measure applies to racist abuse, hooliganism and other antisocial behaviour and is believed to have been drawn up in response to protests that took place outside the home of the Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward last month. In a statement, the Premier League said: “At today’s shareholders’ meeting, Premier League clubs united against all forms of violent, threatening and abusive behaviour. Following recent events, the 20 clubs committed to introducing a League-wide ban for anyone banned by their club for discriminatory, abusive or violent acts. “Unacceptable conduct towards players, fans, club employees or referees will not be tolerated by the Premier League or its clubs.” The West Ham owner and joint-chairman, David Gold, said he had been fully supportive of the move. “The big issue has been about Ed Woodward and I want to say I feel for him. I’ve experienced it myself, I’ve been abused and it’s awful. “The Burnley game [in which West Ham fans invaded the pitch to protest against the club’s ownership] was a terrible experience. My 10-year-old granddaughter said: ‘Grandpa, what do they mean? You’re not a liar are you, Grandpa?’ I mean, what do you say to a 10-year-old? It was dreadful.” The length of the ban will be determined by the club where the incident occurred, and mirrored by the rest of the division.
