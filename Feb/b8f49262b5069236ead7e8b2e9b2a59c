Three of Nicky Henderson’s Champion Hurdle contenders were among 14 horses sent to Kempton Park on Tuesday for exercise in what has become a traditional part of the buildup to the Festival meeting at Cheltenham, but the absence of Epatante, the big-race favourite, from the away trip seemed only to confirm that she is the clear leader of his deep squad for the feature event on 10 March. While Epatante stayed at home at Seven Barrows, Pentand Hills, Fusil Raffles and Verdana Blue were attempting to confirm a place in the field to take her on, and it seemed afterwards that all three did so without any managing to finish in front of their galloping companions after a circuit and a half of the track. “They all did what they had to,” Henderson said. “It just puts an edge on them and you don’t judge them by results here. I was happy with Pentland and Verdana, and Fusil was all right. “Epatante is surely the one [most likely to win the Champion Hurdle]. I could make a case for Pentland as he did that well but he has another bit of work to come. “I think that was a step forward for Fusil and Daryl [Jacob] was happy. He is a horse that comes to life on a racecourse. He certainly did twice last year and we have got to get him back to that. Verdana Blue is going to have to go on ground that doesn’t suit her, but she is in great form.” There was bad news, though, for anyone who had backed Glynn, an impressive winner at Doncaster last time, for the Ballymore Novice Hurdle, at least if their bet was with a bookie going “all-in, run or not”.

He has only had one run and is a baby. Everybody wants to go to Cheltenham, but it wouldn’t be a sensible thing to do. I’d like to find a nice little race, finish on a good note and put him away for next year.”
