Laura Kenny needed stitches around her right eye after being involved in a nasty crash in the opening race of Friday’s omnium at the track world championships. The four-times Olympic champion, racing in Berlin only a month after breaking her shoulder during the omnium at last month’s World Cup in Canada, fell just before the final lap of the scratch race and was hit by two riders. Kenny, bleeding close to her right eye, received lengthy treatment from Great Britain’s medical team at the side of the track. She was one of five riders injured in the crash, with Mexico’s Lizbeth Salazar taken from the track on a stretcher. Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands, the reigning omnium world champion and a major threat to Kenny’s Olympic crown, was relegated from second place for causing the incident. Victory went to Japan’s Yumi Kajihara, with the American Jennifer Valente moving up to second after Wild’s relegation. Kenny continued in the event despite her medal hopes effectively being over, seeing the race as a learning opportunity against her Olympic rivals. British Cycling said Kenny had stitches around her right eye and got the all-clear from doctors following a concussion check. She fell hardest on her right hip, sparing the injured shoulder the full force of the blow, with the cut and a black eye caused by the visor on her helmet. The 27-year-old has otherwise had a successful few days in Berlin, picking up team pursuit silver on Thursday, despite insisting she would not race in the event, and finishing fourth in Wednesday’s scratch race. She could have been forgiven for pulling out of the rest of the omnium but kept going. When the event resumed, Allison Beveridge, Salazar and Taiwan’s Ting Ying-huang were missing as a result of injuries in the crash. Kenny was on the attack early in the tempo race but failed to pick up points as Belarus’ Tatsiana Sharakova took victory.
