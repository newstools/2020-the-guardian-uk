It’s the date the world has been waiting for, for more than 900 years. Sunday – 02/02/2020 – is the first “global” palindrome since 11/11/1111. Unlike other palindromic dates, such as 10/02/2001, 2 February, 2020 is considered a global palindrome because it is exactly the same written both in the DD/MM/YYYY format as well as the US standard of MM/DD/YYYY. And for nations like China, where the year comes first, 2020/02/02 also works. The second of February also happens to be the 33rd day of the year with 333 days remaining. Okay as well as 02/02/2020 being #PalindromeDay I’ve just found out it’s the 33rd day of the year with 333 days to go and that makes me a very happy maths boy indeed 💙 A palindrome is any number or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards. For most people, a global palindrome happens only once in the their lifetime. The moment sparked a celebration of palindromes on social media. For #PalindromeDay (02 02 2020) a musical palindrome by Villa-Lobos. Here's the first bar of Etude No. 1 for guitar: pic.twitter.com/7HYIBbEH3H Read this one backwards!
