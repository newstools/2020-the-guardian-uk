Scrub 350g of small potatoes then cook them, in their skins, in deep, lightly salted boiling water for about 15 minutes until tender. While they are cooking, cut 6-8 langoustines in half lengthways. Place them, cut side up, on a grill pan. Brush with olive oil and dust lightly with smoked paprika. Heat an overhead grill. Make a dressing by mixing 5 tbsp of natural yogurt with 150g of mayonnaise. Finely chop a small bunch of coriander and the leaves from 8 sprigs of parsley. Add to the mix and season with the juice of half a lemon and a little black pepper. Drain the potatoes and slice them into thick coins. While they are still hot, put them into the dressing with the leaves of a head of chicory and turn gently until they are lightly coated, then divide between two plates. Cook the langoustines under the grill for 4 minutes until the flesh starts to turn opaque. Put the grilled langoustines on top of the potato salad and serve. Enough for two for a light supper. This fish salad will be infinitely better if you slice the hot potatoes directly into the dressing. They soak more of it up than if they are dressed once they have gone cold. When I cook potatoes for a salad, I leave them in the water for a few minutes longer than usual. I like them to crumble and break in the dressing. The juices of the langoustines are wonderful with the warm potatoes, but other fish is a possibility. Prawns in their shells or mussels are prime candidates for grilling, but I could be tempted to use cod cheeks, fried for a couple of minutes in butter and dusted, a minute before they are ready, with paprika and a little salt. Tip the smoky, buttery cooking juices over the salad, too.
