Given their pick of opposition to equal Manchester City’s run of 18 straight wins in the Premier League, one suspects Liverpool would probably have plumped for West Ham. Under their self-professed “winner” of a manager David Moyes, the Hammers have failed to muster victory in any of their past six games and seem extremely unlikely to do anything of the sort on a cold and windy Monday night against the champions elect at Anfield. Currently one point from safety and with his team negotiating an extremely tough run of fixtures that looks likely to stretch to the end of this season and far into the next one, Moyes has conceded his players “have a job to do to stay up”. It is a job that has been made considerably more difficult by the shoulder-knack suffered by Ryan Fredericks against Manchester City last week, which means the right-back faces a prolonged spell on the sidelines. Luckily, Moysie has options as he sets about the tricky business of containing Sadio Mané and must choose between picking Jeremy Ngakia, a 19-year-old with one senior appearance – against the same opposition – under his belt, or the vastly more experienced Pablo Zabaleta, 73, who moves with all the speed of a glacier. The former Everton boss has hinted it is the likeable veteran who will get the nod on Monday night in a managerial move that could almost be interpreted as workplace bullying. “I am keen to give the young players the opportunity,” Moyes said of Ngakia. “Ideally it would not be in this situation and at Anfield away or in this situation where we are in the league. Ideally, you would try to bed them in but it does not always come perfectly. Zabaleta, as you know, has been incredibly reliable and has a great personality when he plays.” In the event that Zabaleta does manage to shackle Mané through the sheer force of his winning smile and scintillating repartee, West Ham must also concern themselves with stopping 10 other players on a team that is now so good their manager recently spoke of his concern that potential recruits might be too intimidated to join them. “On the one side, it’s easier if players see you as [the best in the world] because if they see you are successful, it’s easier to get into talks with players,” he said, before musing on the problems of being just too darned good looking. “But on the other side, it’s more difficult the better your team is because they ask questions like ‘where and when would I play?’” Liverpool go into the West Ham game still stinging from their Big Cup defeat at the hands of Atlético Madrid last week, hoping to equal or break a series of records: most consecutive Premier League victories, most consecutive home wins and most fairly inconsequential records broken in a season. In the event of defeat or even an unlikely draw for West Ham, their “winner” of a manager will at least mark a little milestone of his own – 16 trips to Anfield as the boss of assorted teams without masterminding a single victory.

The Geordies are sleepwalking to relegation, just seven points above the drop, with the lowest pass completion rate, lowest number of attempts on goal, and joint fewest goals in the league; they are absolutely murder, he wrote” – Johnny Connelly. “So, now we’ve had a review of the VAR review of the referee’s decision. How long before we get a review of the review of the VAR review of the referee’s decision … and so on. Just make it a review of a clear and obvious error and give the VAR a maximum 30 seconds to decide. Then we can get on with the game” – Peter Thew. “I wonder when your campaign masterminds finally had enough. When clenched fists hit the boardroom table and Tin went flying everywhere.
