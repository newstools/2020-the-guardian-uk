Pakistan’s 16-year-old paceman Naseem Shah has become the youngest player to take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Naseem dismissed the Bangladesh trio of Najmul Hossain, Taijul Islam and Mahmudullah in the first Test at Rawalpindi. Naseem trapped Najmul and the nightwatchman Taijul lbw, the first dismissal given out after a Pakistan review, before Mahmudullah fell to a smart Haris Sohail catch. The Pakistan medium-pacer Abdul Razzaq was the previous youngest player to take a Test match hat-trick, against Sri Lanka in 2000 at the age of 20. At the end of day three, Bangladesh closed on 126 for six in their second innings, 86 runs short of making Pakistan bat again after their first-innings total of 445. In December, Naseem bowled Pakistan to victory against Sri Lanka, sealing his country’s first home Test series win since 2006 and becoming the second youngest player to take five wickets in a Test innings.
