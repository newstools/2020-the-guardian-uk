An image of a windswept Donald Trump, which appears to show a dramatic forehead tan line through his blown-back blond hair, has gone viral – prompting the hashtag #orangeface to trend on Twitter. This image was posted late Friday afternoon to an unverified Twitter account called White House Photos, which describes itself as the account of a “White House Correspondent, Journalist, Photographer, Poet and Pesco Vegetarian” named “William Moon.” White House Photos tweeted a black-and-white version of the image shortly thereafter, with the caption: “Today, ⁦DonaldTrump⁩ was dancing with the sunset and strong winds when he walked to the Oval Office from the Marine One on the South Lawn.. Photo by William Moon in the White House on February 7, 2020.” Trump, who is known to be sensitive about his appearance, did not take kindly to this image and said on Twitter of the black-and-white version on Saturday: “More Fake News. This was photoshopped, obviously, but the wind was strong and the hair looks good? Anything to demean!” ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ returns to the White House from Charlotte, North Carolina.

White House Photos later said in a tweet: “This picture was never photoshopped, but used the Apple smartphone’s photo app to adjust the color of the picture.” People on the internet didn’t worry too much about its authenticity – or Trump’s hurt feelings – in lampooning him. One user wrote: “The stain of impeachment never washes off.” And one meme featured the caption: “Tupperware after you store spaghetti in it.”
