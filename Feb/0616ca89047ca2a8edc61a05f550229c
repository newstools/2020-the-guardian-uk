A Mini appears to have careered off the road and been abandoned in heavy snow near Buxton, in Derbyshire. The Guardian photographer Don McPhee captured the image in January 1979. It was published on the front page of the paper on 29 January that year, alongside a report that troops were on emergency standby because of the weather. Sharp shadows suggest the sun has broken through the cloud, while the sheep boast their thick winter coats. Only the presence of the car dates this photograph, in what is an otherwise timeless landscape. McPhee, who died in 2007, had a long career at the Guardian, photographing in particular his beloved northern England.Words: Hannah Booth Buy your exclusive print here Price£50, including free delivery PrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.
