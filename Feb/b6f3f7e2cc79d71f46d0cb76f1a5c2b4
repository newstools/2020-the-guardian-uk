Jill Stephenson is mistaken in her complaints about the Scottish parliament proportional representation system (Letters, 19 February). She says the Green party “won 0.6% of the vote and received six list seats”. The Green party won 0.6% of the constituency vote, but also took 6.6% of the top-up list votes, giving them their six seats. Does Ms Stephenson wish to return to constituency first-past-the-post-only voting? Under that scenario the SNP’s majority at Holyrood would be overwhelming.Mark McKergowEdinburgh • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
