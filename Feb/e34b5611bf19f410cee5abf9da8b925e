Jofra Archer has been ruled out of England’s upcoming tour to Sri Lanka and the Indian Premier League. Further scans on Archer’s injured right elbow in the UK on Wednesday confirmed a low grade stress fracture of the right elbow that will keep him out of action for around three months. The 24-year-old fast bowler sustained a bone stress injury to his right elbow following England’s opening Test against South Africa at Centurion last month and was ruled out of the final three matches of a series Joe Root’s team won 3-1. Archer underwent repeat scans in the UK after swelling on the injury had reduced after initial scans did not detect a fracture. He will now begin rehabilitation with the ECB targeting an international in June against West Indies in a three-match Test series.
