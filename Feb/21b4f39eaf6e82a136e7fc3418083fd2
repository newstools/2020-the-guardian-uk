It’s about 45 years ago since the Guardian last ran a lengthy correspondence on growing loofahs (Letters, 1 February). We tried to grow them at the time on our bathroom windowsill but only produced fruit the size of small gherkins – a horticultural triumph but useless for washing purposes. I wonder if global warming would make it worth our while to repeat the experiment? And might loofahs perhaps replace marmalade as your next topic thread?Jane McAdoo London • Your report (‘Big echo chamber’: Mistakes of Sydney’s opera house to be addressed after 47 years, 31 January) brings to mind a comment of the late Sir Thomas Beecham about the Royal Albert Hall: “It’s the only place where a composer can hear the premiere of his work twice.”Philip AllenKentish Town, London • Don’t let Brexiters score an easy goal by impugning remainers’ knowledge of and love for Britain’s coast. The “defocused white cliffs of Dover” (Letters, 1 February) pictured on the front page of Friday’s Guardian were not a product of genius but rather showed the iconic Seven Sisters, with Belle Tout lighthouse visible close to Beachy Head, some 75 miles by road west of Dover. We in remain-voting Brighton should know.Michael DunneBrighton • OK, so the film 1917 “cleverly enfolds narrative and character within [its] flow” (Baftas coverage, 3 February), but the question remains: who milked that cow, so shortly before the two soldiers saw it?Fr Alec Mitchell Holyhead, Anglesey • I’ve recently emptied my wormery and, unlike Jonathan Hammonds’ experience (Letters, 1 February), all the Guardian bags came out as intact as the day they went in. Evidently not to the worms’ liking.Nick StarlingLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
