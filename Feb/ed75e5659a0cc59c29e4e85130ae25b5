Undefeated British heavyweights Daniel Dubois and Joe Joyce will face each other in their native London on 11 April. Olympic silver medallist Joyce, 34, and British, Commonwealth, WBC Silver and WBO International champion Dubois, 22, will meet at the O2 Arena. Dubois, who is 14-0 in his professional career, said: “This is the biggest fight of my career without doubt. This will be the fight that announces me to the world.” Joyce added: “This is a massive fight, there’s no denying that there’s a lot on the line on both sides but experience is something you can’t buy and I’ve got tonnes of it and I believe it’ll play a huge factor in this fight.”
