I have a taste for adventure, but my partner would rather stay at home. We have just returned from a short break, during which he spent much of the time complaining. We have been together for 12 years, I love him dearly and our relationship is fantastic. However, I feel I have missed out because of his reluctance to travel. I would love to have cycled across Europe, for example. I don’t want to go alone and my friends are in relationships and I don’t fancy gatecrashing family holidays or romantic breaks. Is anyone else in the same boat? If so, what do you do? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
