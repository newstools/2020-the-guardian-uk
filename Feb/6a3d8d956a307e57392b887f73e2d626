I am recently out of a long-term relationship and have developed an intense crush on my new line manager. We have an intellectual connection and I feel we just get each other. I have not felt this way for a long time. I am unsure of their feelings and whether I have interpreted this as a sexual connection when perhaps they see it as merely a strong and positive working relationship. How do I explore whether there is something really there and how – if at all – should I act on my feelings? • When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help and may well view your comments here.
