I love blood oranges, and some of the pleasure in making this cocktail comes from simply cutting open the fruit and seeing that glorious colour. Blitzing the juice for 15 seconds in a blender makes it aerated and fluffy, which takes away a lot of the fruit’s sharp, citrussy flavour and helps balance the drink. This drink is inspired by Jim Meehan, co-founder of the legendary New York speakeasy PDT. Serves 1 30ml whisky – any blended variety will do, but I favour Rock Island, a slightly saline blend of Islay, Arran, Jura and Orkney malts15ml good vermouth – we use Carpano Antica Formula, which is very expensive; if you prefer, go for Dolin Rouge or Martini Rosso15ml Heering cherry liqueur25ml blood orange juice, fresh, ideally, and blitzed (see intro)1 twist blood orange zest, to garnish (optional) Put the whisky, vermouth and cherry liqueur in a shaker with ice and shake vigorously. Gently fold in the fluffy, blitzed blood orange juice, then strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with blood orange zest, if you wish, and serve.Sugar Boat, Helensburgh, Scotland
