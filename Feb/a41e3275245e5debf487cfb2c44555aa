In 1959, the year after the Munich disaster, at the age of 10, I cycled from my home in Timperley to Harry Gregg’s house in Sale in order to try to get his autograph. When I knocked at the door his wife invited me in as Harry hadn’t got back from training. I was devastated to learn from your obituary (18 February) that she must have died a year or so later. When Harry returned, we sat and had a cup of tea and talked about Manchester United and football in general but not, obviously, about Munich. I left with a signed photograph and a wonderful memory of the afternoon. I don’t suppose that such a thing could happen today. A great man and a very fine goalkeeper. I still haven’t forgiven Nat Lofthouse for that foul in the cup final.Bob WoodManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
