Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Our family love frothy coffees and we’d like to start making them at home. We can make the coffee bit, but are considering buying a milk frother. The electric ones cost £30, but do they work? Is there a good one that you’d recommend? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
