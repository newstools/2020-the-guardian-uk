Ireland’s Six Nations rugby matches against Italy in Dublin on the weekend of 6-8 March have been postponed – and possibly cancelled – because of the coronavirus outbreak. Philip Browne, the chief executive of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), announced the decision on Wednesday afternoon after meeting a delegation of health officials led by the health minister, Simon Harris. Browne said: “We were then advised, formally, that the National Public Health Emergency team has determined that the series of matches should not proceed, in the interests of public health. The IRFU is perfectly happy to comply with this instruction.” He added that the 7 March men’s game at the Aviva Stadium as well as the women’s match on 8 March and an Under-20s Six Nations fixture between the countries on 6 March may be held later: “We will immediately begin to work with our Six Nations partners to look at the possibility of rescheduling those matches. I would hope to have an update on that in the coming days.” The IRFU had been expected to act after Harris said on Tuesday that Italy’s multiplying cases of coronavirus made the games – which would draw thousands of Italian fans to Dublin – too risky. He had said: “The very clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game should not go ahead, that it would constitute a very significant risk,” said Harris. The sports minister, Shane Ross, added pressure on the IRFU by backing his cabinet colleague, saying cancellation would be disappointing but necessary. Meanwhile the chief medical officer at the department of health, Tony Holohan, said other mass gatherings such as St Patrick’s day celebrations on 17 March would be reviewed. St Patrick’s festival organisers said in a statement: “We follow the advice and direction of relevant authorities in all matters of public safety.”
