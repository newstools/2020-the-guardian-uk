NFL offensive tackle Greg Robinson remained in a Texas jail without bond on Wednesday after federal agents said they found 157lb (71kg) of marijuana in a rented vehicle in which he and two other people were riding. Robinson, 27, of Thibodeaux, Louisiana, and Jaquan Tyreke Bray, 26, of La Grange, Georgia, were charged with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute. Both were held without bond pending an initial appearance before a judge. If convicted, both could be sentenced to up to 20 years in federal prison. According to a criminal complaint by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Robinson, Bray and an unidentified third person were driving from Los Angeles to Louisiana in a rented car through a remote section of West Texas. When they passed a Border Patrol agent with a drug-sniffing dog, the animal detected the scent of marijuana. The agent radioed ahead to a checkpoint where the patrol inspected the vehicle, finding several large duffel bags containing marijuana. Also found were glass jars and packaging equipment, along with $3,100 in cash. Agents said the unidentified passenger was an Uber driver who also drove and ran errands for Robinson and his family and friends. The passenger showed agents cellphone texts that showed Robinson had offered to pay the passenger to claim ownership of the marijuana, according to the complaint. The texts showed the passenger refused and would not have made the trip if aware of the drugs in the vehicle. The person was not charged. Robinson was drafted second overall in 2014, by the St Louis Rams. He signed with the Cleveland Browns in 2018. The Browns recently informed Robinsonâ€™s representatives they did not intend to re-sign him as a free agent. Robinson battled inconsistency while starting 14 games last season for the Browns, who had a disappointing 6-10 season. He was benched for one game and missed another with a concussion. He has earned $29.1m during his NFL career.
