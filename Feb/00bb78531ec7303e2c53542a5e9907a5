A much-changed Celtic side overcame the elements to secure a William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final place with a 3-0 win over Clyde at Broadwood. The Hoops famously lost in the tournament to the Bully Wee at the same venue in 2006 but, after French midfielder Olivier Ntcham opened the scoring in the 16th minute, there was little chance of lightning striking a second time, despite Storm Ciara making conditions extremely difficult. Scott Brown stabbed in a second five minutes before the interval to further deflate the League One side, with substitute Vakoun Bayo adding a third in the last minute. Ultimately, notwithstanding the foul weather, it was a comfortable afternoon for the Hoops, who have won the last 10 competitions in Scotland and are looking to win the Scottish Cup for an unprecedented fourth successive time. In the dayâ€™s other game, a Marc McNulty hat-trick gave Hibernian a 4-1 victory over BSC Glasgow of the Lowland League.
