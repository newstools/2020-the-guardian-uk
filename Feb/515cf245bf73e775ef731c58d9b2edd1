A deal of pity can be felt for West Ham who follow up a defeat at Manchester City with a trip to Anfield. Only another win for Liverpool feels likely especially after losing narrowly in Spain on Tuesday. The defeat against Atlético Madrid will have stung a little and Jürgen Klopp will be keen for his side to salve the wound. David Moyes’s side are winless in seven in all competitions but their fixture run looks challenging. Next up are Southampton, Arsenal, Wolves, Tottenham annd Chelsea. Relegation fears could begin to escalate quickly.
