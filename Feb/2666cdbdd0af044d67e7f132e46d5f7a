Former Seattle Seahawks quarterback Trevone Boykin has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to charges from a 2018 assault on his girlfriend. Boykin and prosecutors agreed to the sentence in return for his guilty plea on Wednesday to aggravated assault and witness tampering charges. Boykin’s attorney said his client will be eligible for parole in less than a year. Shabrika Bailey alleged that Boykin broke her jaw in two places in the March 2018 assault. The Seahawks cut Boykin shortly afterwards. Boykin was a college star for the TCU Horned Frogs, setting team career records in several categories. He joined the Seahawks in 2016, and played in five games in 2016, completing 13 of 18 passes for 145 yards and one touchdown and one interception. He spent 2017 on the Seahawks practice squad. He had been in trouble with the law since 2015, however, when he had a barroom brawl in San Antonio two days before the Frogs were to meet the Alamo Ducks in the 2016 Alamo Bowl. He was suspended for the game, then pleaded no contest to a resisting-arrest count and got a year’s deferred adjudication probation in June 2016. In March 2017, he was arrested on public intoxication and misdemeanor marijuana possession charges after a car in which he was a passenger struck a tavern, hitting seven people on the sidewalk.
