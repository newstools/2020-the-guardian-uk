We are increasingly concerned by the escalating humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, Syria, and the inadequate international action to end the suffering. Since 1 December more than 600,000 of Idlib’s 3 million residents have been displaced, and hundreds have been killed; the victims are disproportionately women and children. Civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools, has been repeatedly hit and destroyed. Spiralling prices and insufficient aid have left people desperate for food, clean water, shelter, medical care and other essential items, with crowds massing on the Turkish border where there is nothing in place to support them. Despite the immense suffering, the crisis is not being treated with the urgency it demands, and with frontlines approaching the densely populated Idlib city, the humanitarian crisis will deteriorate further if action is not taken. A failure to act will result in more civilians dying. The UK government and other world leaders should take steps to condemn the violence, call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and for those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law to be held accountable.
