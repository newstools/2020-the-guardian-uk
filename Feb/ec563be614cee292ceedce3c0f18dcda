1) Gale force winds during Storm Ciara? Tick. Heavy old bikes? Tick. A bridge over the North Sea? Tick. It’s the 2020 Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships.

Yes please. 1) Extreme rollerblading … in Rwanda: 2) An unfortunate Chiefs fan is pole-axed at Kansas City’s Super Bowl parade. 3) Sergio García takes on Henrik Stenson in the 14-club challenge. 4) Enho Akira’s spectacular sumo showreel.
