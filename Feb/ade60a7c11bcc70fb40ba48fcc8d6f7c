Ruben Loftus-Cheek has moved closer towards returning to first-team action after playing 60 minutes for Chelsea’s development squad in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Brentford B on Tuesday. The game was held at Chelsea’s training ground and was used to assess Loftus-Cheek, who had not played since rupturing his left achilles during a post-season friendly against New England Revolution in Boston last May. The midfielder is thought to have shown no ill effects. Signs of Loftus-Cheek making good progress in his recovery is a boost for Chelsea, who have missed the 24-year-old’s driving runs from midfield. Loftus-Cheek was playing well before his setback, impressing on the ball and offering a goal threat, and the England international is expected to become an important player for Frank Lampard. However there is a recognition that Loftus-Cheek, who has spent longer on the sidelines than initially expected, cannot rush his rehabilitation. He returned to first-team training only at the end of January, following a brief spell working with the under-16s, and the messaging around him has been cautious. The next step will be building on his training-ground work and gaining match fitness with the under-23s. Chelsea have two weeks off because of the Premier League’s mid-season break, giving Loftus-Cheek space to continue working away from the spotlight. “Where we are having a bit of time off for the players, he won’t, he’ll be working,” Lampard said last week. “He’ll be with the 23s to try and get some minutes … Hopefully after the break we can talk about him more when he is going to come back into the squad.”
