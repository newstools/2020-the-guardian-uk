The Milwaukee Bucks have a spot in the postseason, only a week after the All-Star Game. The Bucks became the first team in the NBA to clinch a berth this season after Washington lost to Chicago on Sunday. The Wizards are in ninth place in an Eastern Conference that the Bucks have been running away with for months. Milwaukee have a 48-8 record, on pace to join the Golden State Warriors (2015-16) and Chicago Bulls (1995-96) as the only teams in NBA history to win 70 games. Enjoy this Sunday bucks fans. Earliest playoff clinch in NBA history. It’s not even March yet!! “Enjoy this Sunday bucks fans. Earliest playoff clinch in NBA history. It’s not even March yet!!” Bucks senior vice president Alex Lasry wrote on Twitter. The Bucks did clinch on an earlier date than the Warriors, but the NBA season also now starts slightly earlier. The postseason starts on 18 April. The Bucks’ success has been driven in large part by reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. He is averaging 30 points, 13.6 rebounds, 5.8 assists per game this season. His PER rating this season, which measures a player’s overall contribution is 32.49, the highest in history. By comparison, Michael Jordan had the highest PER rating across a career at 27.91.
