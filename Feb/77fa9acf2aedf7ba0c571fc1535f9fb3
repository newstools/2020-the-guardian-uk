The comedian Peter Kay is set to return to the stage, three years after cancelling all of his projects due to “unforeseen family circumstances”. The 46-year-old, who rose to fame with mockumentary series That Peter Kay Thing and later masterminded shows including Phoenix Nights and Peter Kay’s Car Share, will perform in six Dance for Life charity shows. He has previously hosted 14 of the danceathon events, in which participants raise money for Cancer Research UK. In a statement, Kay said: “I’ve honestly never had so much fun as I had working on Dance for Life. The atmosphere was so happy and positive; it really is a great way to raise money for the worthiest of causes.” Peter Kay's #DanceForLife is back! The charity dance-a-thon announces 2020 dates, including Manchester and London for the very first time. Raising money for @CR_UK.

In 2017, Kay detailed his regret at cancelling more than 100 shows across Britain and Ireland: “Due to unforeseen family circumstances, I deeply regret that I am having to cancel all of my upcoming work projects … My sincerest apologies. This decision has not been taken lightly and I’m sure you’ll understand my family must always come first.” He added that he had “always endeavoured to protect [his] family’s privacy from the media”. Kay’s acclaimed sitcom, Peter Kay’s Car Share, ended with the broadcast in May 2018 of two previously recorded finale specials. A spokesperson for Kay described a Channel 5 documentary released about him last year, Peter Kay: Comedy Genius – In His Own Words, as “incredibly misleading”. The clip show did not feature any new contributions from Kay.
