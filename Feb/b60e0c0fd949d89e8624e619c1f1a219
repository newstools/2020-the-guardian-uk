Despite the efforts of Robert Ponsonby as director of the Edinburgh festival (Obituary, 24 February), Maria Callas did not sing in La Sonnambula there on the night that I went to see it in 1957. As I arrived clutching my ticket for what had been advertised as her fifth and final performance at the festival, I found out that Callas was catching the next plane home. She was replaced by Renata Scotto, whose career was thus much enhanced. Nor did I see her co-lead, Giuseppe Di Stefano, who pleaded a bad throat and was replaced by Nicolai Gedda. Fortunately, both Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Victoria de los Ángeles were in good health and voice, and I was able to attend both recitals. Quite a week, and thank you, Robert Ponsonby.Arthur SummerfieldBeeston, Nottinghamshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
