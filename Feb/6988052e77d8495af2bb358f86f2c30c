The mixed emotions of Brexit day show the UK is not yet at ease with itself, writes Jonathan Freedland (1 February) – and nor are the European citizens in Britain at ease. The mantra “the people have voted” not only discounted the 48% who were remainers, but also wrote off the 3 million Europeans who live, love and labour here. My home of 40 years is not unquestioningly my home any more. I have to justify being here. I ask myself whether as a teacher of German, French and Spanish I am one of the “skilled workers” Britain needs, when languages are cut from the curriculum in the underfunded schools. My fellow Europeans have to seek “settled status” or, like me, apply for British citizenship. The irony of paying nearly £2,000 for a British passport just to secure my rights at a time when I feel least affinity to this country does not escape me. Am I still able to explain that I love living in Britain because it celebrates diversity, because of the multicultural vibe of its cities? The mood has changed – instead of cosmopolitan openness, a narrow-minded chauvinism has come to the fore. A prime minister who stokes up anti-EU sentiment, berating Europeans for treating the UK “as though it’s basically part of their own country” has made an ugly nationalism acceptable. Do the flag-waving Brits still want me here? Do I still want to contribute to their society? Is divided Brexit Britain still my country, my home?Christine FuchsChigwell, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
