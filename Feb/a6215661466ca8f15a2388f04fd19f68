Serves 1 3cm piece cucumber, chopped up1-3 fresh dill sprigs, to taste, plus 1 sprig extra, to garnish50ml gin 15ml fresh lemon juice12.5ml elderflower cordial – I use Bottlegreen7ml 1:1 sugar syrup Muddle (ie, bash) the cucumber and dill in the base of a shaker, add all the other ingredients and a handful of ice, and shake for 10 seconds.
