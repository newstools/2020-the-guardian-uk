While the cliche of scousers frantically urging each other to “calm down, calm down” is a lazy one, The Fiver is willing to bet its bottom dollar there were no shortage of Liverpool fans doing exactly that earlier on Tuesday. Out of the blue, the shock news that a famous German football manager named Jürgen had suddenly resigned was announced, prompting the red half of Merseyside to go into total meltdown. With calm duly restored and a collective sigh of relief blowing through Britain like Storm Ciara, it emerged that, contrary to the worst fears of Liverpool fans, the now ex-gaffer boasting the initials “JK” on his club gilet is in fact Jürgen Klinsmann, who has stepped down as boss of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin after just 10 weeks at the helm. Having taken over in late November, steered the club out of the relegation zone and spent around £70m on a January transfer trolley dash, the World Cup winner seemed to be on top of his brief but cited a lack of solidarity and trust from suits unspecified as the reason for his decision to quit. “We were on a good path and despite difficult games had moved six points away from the relegation spots,” he explained on social media disgrace FaceSpace. “I am totally convinced that Hertha will stay up. But for that task to be completed, as head coach I need the trust of all those involved. In the fight against relegation unity, solidarity and concentration are the key elements. If they are not guaranteed then I cannot deliver on my full potential as a coach and cannot live up to my responsibilities.” Having swallow-dived into Berlin’s Olympiastadion promising to keep Hertha up and transform them into title contenders with the financial backing of major investor Lars Windhorst, Klinsmann will remain at the club as part of the “supervisory board” upon which he sat before taking over from Ante Covic. “We were surprised about this development,” parped Hertha in a club statement. “Especially after the trusting cooperation regarding personnel decisions during the intensive winter transfer window, there was no sign of this. We will inform you about further developments in due course.” While the club come to terms with this shock news, Klinsmann’s assistant, Alexander Nouri, has been put in charge, while his former boss sets about the process of calming things down by helping to identify and appoint his own replacement. “In Paris, I missed the chance to become the best coach in the world. I won the league, four domestic cups and two Trophées des Champions. But the ultimate goal was [Big Cup]. The first year, in the round of 16 against Barcelona, we played a really high-level first leg. In the return leg, we were knocked out because VAR didn’t yet exist” – Unai Emery there, with an interesting take on what caused his career to nosedive.

I can’t imagine why anyone at The Fiver would think that sort of thing is worth rewarding – Scott L Henderson. “Down here in the land of Oz, Guardian Australia regularly conducts opinion polls on the state of our political leaders. This fortnight for example, PM Scott Morrison has an approval rating of 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance. Fiver readers’ perspicacity and influence is almost greater than I thought. The poll’s sample size is 1,056 respondents” – Stephen Hodgson. “Fun fact: rhinos may have thick skin, but their derma is actually quite sensitive and can be easily scarred. The comparison between these majestic unicorns and Everton’s sometimes-majestic No 1 (yesterday’s Fiver) may be even more apt than thought, with the Netherlands’ former choice between the sticks now sitting between the subs at Goodison, Pickford may find his position in the pecking order ‘endangered’” – Matt Richman. “Re: Jordan Pickford moaning that everyone hates England players, I can confirm, as a Scotsman, that this is 100% true” – Mathew Conway. “Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
