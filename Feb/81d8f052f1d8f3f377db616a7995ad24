Please send us your tips on restaurants close to main railway stations in Europe (excluding the UK). It may have been how you kicked off a city break or the last hurrah of a long weekend away; you may just have been feeling peckish between changes and had a couple of hours to kill. Whether it was a spur-of-the-moment or planned visit, please share details. Bear in mind we’re looking for tips on good-value restaurants – not expensive, exclusive meals. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including useful websites and prices) in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and the winner will receive two first-class Interrail Global Passes from Eurail that allow for seven days of travel within one month, and are worth up to £384 each (depending on the age of the traveller). This competition closes at 10am GMT on Wednesday 19 February 2020, and a selection of entrants will be published on or soon after Friday 21 February.
