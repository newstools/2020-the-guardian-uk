From a feminist retelling of Moby-Dick to a fresh look at Cinderella from the perspective of her stepsister, the longlist for the UK’s top children’s book prize, the Carnegie Medal, is packed with reimaginings of classic stories. Established in 1936, the Carnegie has been won by some of the UK’s best-loved children’s authors, including Noel Streatfeild and CS Lewis. The 20 books in the running this year range from Kit de Waal’s first young adult novel, Becoming Dinah – a reimagining of Moby-Dick in which a teenage girl sets off on a trip in a camper van with a grumpy one-legged man – to Jennifer Donnelly’s take on Cinderella, Stepsister, and Sharon Dogar’s Monsters, about the creation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. A host of picture books up for the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration also give fresh takes on the classics. And the Ocean Was Our Sky, illustrated by Rovina Cai and written by Patrick Ness, tells the story of Moby-Dick from the perspective of the whale; Quill Soup, illustrated by Dale Blankenaar, is an African retelling of the European folktale Stone Soup; and Mary and Frankenstein, illustrated by Júlia Sardà and written by Linda Bailey, is another title to riff on the making of Frankenstein. This year also marks a first for the prize: Annet Schaap’s story of a lighthouse keeper’s daughter, Lampie, translated from Dutch by Laura Watkinson, is the the first translated book to be longlisted for the Carnegie. Chair of judges Julia Hale called it “as satisfyingly dark and light as the best fairy story adventures”. Taking as their mission “to inspire and empower the next generation to shape a better world through books and reading”, and focusing on finding an “outstanding reading experience”, judges also found a strong theme of homelessness and identity in the longlisted novels. In Susin Nielsen’s No Fixed Address, a boy and his mother live in a camper van, one step from homelessness, while in former winner Sarah Crossan’s Toffee, a teenager runs away from home and is taken in by an elderly woman with dementia. Angie Thomas’s On the Come Up follows an aspiring rapper trying to escape the poverty of her neighbourhood, while Nikesh Shukla’s The Boxer, about the aftermath of a racist attack, is “brilliantly nuanced”, said Hale, and left judges “simultaneously bruised, reeling and uplifted”. Hale said that among the 162 submissions for the two medals, there were lots of books about social media and the internet. But the titles chosen by a volunteer team of 14 children’s and youth librarians from across the UK were “more about universal things, like families and friendships and the way children and young people navigate the sort of challenges that they face in the world”. “Through writing and illustration, the authors and artists offer children and young people stories of hope, discovery and understanding about themselves and the world they live in,” said Hale. “There is a strong emphasis in the longlists on how young readers can navigate that journey, through relationships with families and friends and from learning more about themselves.” The shortlists for both prizes will be announced on 19 March, and the winners on 17 June.
