Derek Fowlds and I worked together in the early days of the Young Vic company, and he was a fine stage actor. After a matinee of the Scottish play in Acapulco a group of us were walking across a square. Derek was saying how thrilled he was to be doing Shakespeare and to have shaken off his association with Basil Brush. Then a young boy ran up to him saying: “Señor Derek, Señor Derek!” Much laughter from us all.
