Please send us your tips on fantastic museums and galleries – famous and little-known – you have spent time in close to a main railway station in Europe (excluding the UK). It might have been the starting point or the final port of call on a city break; you might even have just been killing time between changes. Whether it was a spur of the moment or planned visit please share details. Send tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can (including useful websites and prices) in around 100 words. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are welcome if they are high-quality and you are happy to share but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and the winner will receive two first-class Interrail Global Passes from Eurail that allow for seven days of travel within one month, and are worth up to £384 each (depending on the age of the traveller). This competition closes at 10am GMT on Wednesday 12 February 2020, and a selection of entrants will be published on or soon after Friday 14 February.
