The New Zealand director Taika Waititi has made one superfan’s day after personally endorsing a Twitter account that collects pictures of him napping. Waititi is the focus of an extensive thread known as “Taika Naptiti”, created by fan account @mcuwaititi, that shows the Oscar-winning film-maker in a variety of slumbering and mid-sleeping poses: from directors chairs to award shows. The thread contains more than 30 individual naps, and the Jojo Rabbit and Thor: Ragnarok director gave it a ringing endorsement on Tuesday. Finally! A place where all the photos can live. There are more out there too. People with Taika sleeping photos must come forward. This is a safe space. https://t.co/oJyeQ95qfF taika naptiti: a thread pic.twitter.com/NgeRkDWr1C pic.twitter.com/jl60wOfmJw Waititi’s friends and colleagues such as Thor: Ragnarok actor Mark Ruffalo have since contributed new, original photos of his director napping. I’ll contribute this one of @ChrisHemsworth & me holding you up on the red carpet as you take a two minute nap. https://t.co/B0GxNs46Zt pic.twitter.com/9iEnjMizbc HE POSTED THESE PICTURES FOR ME.

This month Waititi became the first Maori film-maker to win an Academy award. He is currently working on a football comedy, Next Goal Wins, about the true story of American Samoa’s attempt to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.
