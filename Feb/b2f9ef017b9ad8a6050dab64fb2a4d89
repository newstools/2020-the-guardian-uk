Benjamin Moffitt, in his review of the forces of populism, suggests that if anti-populists want to defeat the likes of Trump, they’ll need a different approach (Long read, 14 February). But he doesn’t say what. I’ve looked in vain in the Guardian and other enlightened media for a workable game plan for anti-populists; and I’ve listened in vain to those on the left in the hope that someone will emerge with an anti-populist strategy. Without that strategy, the left in all its guises will not be able to win the political argument for the popular vote by combating the lies and distortions of the populists, who succeed by appealing to the lowest common denominator. We moderate leftists need an argument and an inspiring leader. Sadly I can see neither in the desert that is Britain today.John PawseyMilton Keynes • Benjamin Moffitt’s piece on how to defeat populism never identifies what really divides the two creeds: populists believe their “tribe” is superior to others, and so deserves advantages; anti-populists believe that human beings share a common entitlement to human rights, whether they belong to one’s own tribe (nation state, political, or religious affiliation, gender, etc) or not. So it is hardly surprising that his long read fails to answer the question of how do anti-populists win? It is much harder to sell the anti-populist stance, that a civilised society is distinguished by how it treats its “others”, like transgressors (prisoners, drug addicts), an underclass (poor, disadvantaged, asylum seekers), minorities and foreigners, during a time of economic insecurity: see Nazi Germany for the prime example. The threat of populism is actually best countered with a strong dose of Keynesian economics and wealth redistribution.Dariel FrancisTunbridge Wells, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
