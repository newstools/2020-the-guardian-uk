At least 10 people have been killed and many others injured in a mass shooting carried out by a Thai soldier who remains at large in the north-eastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima. The soldier, who livestreamed the shooting on social media, opened fire at different locations in the city, more than 155 miles (250km) from Bangkok. The soldier reportedly attacked his commanding officer before stealing a gun, ammunition and an army vehicle from a military camp, and proceeding to open fire at a Buddhist temple and a shopping centre. Videos posted online showed people running from what appeared to be the sound of automatic gunfire. The Terminal 21 mall was sealed off by police, who said the gunman remained close to the shopping centre and had not yet been apprehended. Members of the public in Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, had been urged to remain at home. A woman interviewed by Thailand’s Channel One television said she heard gunshots while she was at the mall and hid in a clothing store with other people before escaping. The defence ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit told Reuters news agency: “We don’t know why he did this. It appears he went mad.” Thailand has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, but such attacks are rare in the country, other than in the far south, where a decades-old insurgency persists.The man police identified as the suspect had posted on his Facebook page earlier in the day that: “Death is inevitable for everyone”.
