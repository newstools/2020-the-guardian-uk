At the age of just 10, Jack Nicklaus carded 51 for the first nine holes of golf he ever played. By the time of this charming photograph at the World Match Play Championships in 1966, Nicklaus, then aged 26, had become a six-time major winner, the first man to retain the Masters and the youngest ever to complete a Career Grand Slam. He would go on to achieve a record haul of 18 majors in total. What was the secret of his success, you might ask. “I never try to actually hit the ball,” he explained in The Greatest Game Of All … “I try to swing through the ball”. Nicklaus is also fondly remembered for the charity he showed to Europe captain Tony Jacklin at the 1969 Ryder Cup, when he conceded a two-foot putt on the final hole, ending the tournament in a tie. Nicklaus reportedly told Jacklin: “I don’t think you would have missed it but I wasn’t going to give you the chance, either.” Little wonder, then, that when Nicklaus turned 80 last month, the golfing world saluted him as ‘the greatest’.
