Two people have been charged by detectives investigating a £50 million jewellery raid on heiress Tamara Ecclestone’s London home, Scotland Yard said. Tower Hamlets residents Maria Mester, 47, and 29-year-old Emil-Bogdan Savastru have both been charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. They will appear in custody at Westminster magistrates court. Police said a 21-year-old man arrested at Stansted airport with Mester on Friday has been released under investigation, as has a 31-year-old man arrested in east London on Thursday. Savastru was detained at Heathrow airport on Thursday afternoon on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary and money laundering. The Met has said the arrests were in relation to the burglary in Palace Green, Kensington, on 13 December in which all of Ecclestone’s jewellery was reportedly taken. She was left “angry and shaken” by the incident, according to her father, former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. Police said that in December they were called to the scene by security at the building, which is next to Hyde Park.
