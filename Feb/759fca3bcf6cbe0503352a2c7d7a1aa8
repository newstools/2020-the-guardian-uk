Manchester United’s Tahith Chong is seriously considering an offer to join Internazionale this summer. The 20-year-old’s contract is due to expire in June and Inter are pushing hard to sign him. The forward has been offered a deal to 2025 by Inter worth €3m a year, which equates to around £48,000 a week. Chong is understood to be unconvinced by the renewal proposed by United, whom he joined in 2018 from Feyenoord. Chong, a Netherlands age-group international born in Curaçao, has played eight times for United this season but only twice in the Premier League, on both occasions as a substitute. His agent held talks with Inter this month and the Serie A club, coached by Antonio Conte, are awaiting an answer on their offer. Three of their squad, Romelu Lukaku, Ashley Young and Alexis Sánchez, have played for United.
