“I dedicate this to all the Indigenous kids all over the world who want to do art and dance and write stories,” said Taika Waititi, the New Zealand filmmaker of the Nazi-era satire Jojo Rabbit, as he accepted his Oscar for best adapted screenplay at Monday’s ceremony. “We are the original storytellers and we can make it here as well.” Waititi had just become the first Māori filmmaker to win an Oscar for Jojo Rabbit, which he adapted from the 2008 novel Caging Skies. Waititi also directed the film and starred in it as a bumbling, comedic Adolf Hitler. Jojo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year-old German boy named Jojo, a member of the Hitler youth whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler himself, who discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in the family’s home. Ella Henry, a commentator on the Māori screen industry based at Auckland University of Technology, said although the tale was not on its face an Indigenous one, Waititi had told it in a way that was in keeping with Māori storytelling traditions. “If you look at the way Taika’s films have evolved to use humour and pathos to express trauma, he elevates survival by bringing that pathos and humour and resilience to those stories,” she said. “So I would say it’s a very Māori story.” Jojo Rabbit was also nominated for the Academy Awards’ prestigious best picture category; the film also received nods for best adapted screenplay, film editing, costume design, production design and best supporting actress for Scarlett Johansson, who plays Jojo’s mother. Henry said Waititi was bringing attention to Māori creators – but he was more than just a visible figure in the film industry. “He brought his Indigenous sensibilities to it by asking producers to ensure there were Indigenous trainees in every department,” she said of Waiti’s work directing the Marvel film Thor: Ragnarok. In 2005, Waititi received his first Oscar nomination for the short film Two Cars, One Night.
