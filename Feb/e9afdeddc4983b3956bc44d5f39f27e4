Jordan Henderson will be out for around three weeks with a hamstring injury suffered during Liverpool’s Champions League defeat at Atlético Madrid, according to Jürgen Klopp. The second leg of that tie comes in just under three weeks, on Wednesday 11 March. Henderson appears certain to miss four other matches: the FA Cup tie at Chelsea and three Premier League fixtures, starting with Monday’s at home to West Ham and then games at Watford and at home to Bournemouth. A three-week absence would allow the captain to return for the derby at Everton on Monday 16 March. “It could have been worse,” Klopp said. “We know there are a lot of different hamstring injuries in the Premier League at the moment, with Harry Kane and so on, but it’s not that bad. He will be out for about three weeks, which is not cool. But how we see it, we were still lucky.” The manager added: “Hendo is exceptionally important not just football-wise but for other reasons as well.”
