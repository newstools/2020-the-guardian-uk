Molly Strano has been jettisoned into Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup squad after Tayla Vlaeminck was ruled out with a stress fracture in her foot. Scans this week confirmed Vlaeminck would miss the entire tournament, robbing the host nation of their quickest bowler on wickets expected to suit pace. Vlaeminck, who has suffered several injury setbacks in the past, had taken seven wickets at an average of nine in the recent tri-series against India and England. She had the potential to be a real x-factor for the hosts, and was this week tipped by former player Mel Jones to be the first woman to bowl 130kph. Instead of a like-for-like replacement, coach Matthew Mott has drafted in off-spinning allrounder Strano off two strong domestic seasons. “Tayla has been in brilliant form of late and established herself as one of the premier fast bowlers in international cricket,” Mott said. “No one ever wants to see a player miss a major tournament in these kinds of circumstances. But I have no doubt she will bounce back from this setback and play a leading role in Australian squads for many years to come.” Strano is no newcomer to the national side. She played five Twenty20s for Australia in 2017 and is the leading wicket-taker in Women’s Big Bash League, with 96 scalps at 17.10. Her selection comes ahead of quick Belinda Vakarewa, indicating the Australians are content with the pace options already in the squad. “We are fortunate to have great depth across Australian cricket,” Mott said. “Molly enters the squad in great form having recently been named the domestic player of the year.” The move would likely mean Annabel Sutherland could play a bigger role in the tournament, as Australia’s third seamer alongside fellow allrounder Nicola Carey. Sutherland, the daughter of former Cricket Australia CEO James, is aged just 18 but made an impressive debut against England earlier this month.
