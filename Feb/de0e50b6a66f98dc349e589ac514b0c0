Paul Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola took to Twitter, minutes before Manchester United’s pivotal fixture with Chelsea on Monday to hit out at Ole Gunnar Solskjær. The United manager, frustrated by exhaustive speculation surrounding the midfielder, had seemingly irked Pogba’s camp by saying he belonged to his club, rather than the agent. But, moments before a crucial match in the race for the Champions League places, Raiola took to social media to have his say over the France international’s future. The agent tweeted: “Paul is not mine and for sure not Solskjær’s property. Paul is Paul Pogba’s. You cannot own a human being already for a long time in the UK or anywhere else. I HOPE Solskjær DO NOT WANT TO SUGGEST THAT PAUL IS HIS PRISONER. “But BEFORE Solskjær makes comments about things I say he should inform himself better about the context of what has been said. I am a free citizen who can think and express my thoughts. Until now I was maybe nice to him. Solskjær should just remember things that he said in the summer to Paul. Paul is not mine and for sure not Solskjaer’s property, Paul is Paul Pogba’s. pic.twitter.com/CvBHW8mj8U “I think Solskjær may be frustrated for different reasons and is now mixing up some issues. I think that Solskjær has other things to worry about. AT LEAST IF I WERE HIM I WOULD.” Raiola revealed last week that he has had discussions with the Juventus sporting director Pavel Nedved about a potential return to the Italian champions from where Pogba re-joined United for a £89m in 2016. That speculation was met with a terse response from Solskjær. “I’ve not spoken to Mino that is for sure. And, no, I haven’t sat down and told Paul to tell Mino what he should say. Paul is our player and not Mino’s,” the United manager said. After the 2-0 win over Chelsea, Solskjær added: “I don’t have to comment about Mino Raiola through the media, I can talk to him myself.” When asked if he would, Solskjær said: “Probably not.”
