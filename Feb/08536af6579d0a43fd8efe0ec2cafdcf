The Premier League has voted to revert to the same summer transfer window as Europe’s other major leagues after two years of going it alone. A majority of top-flight clubs agreed to a window that closes after the season has begun. The change will take effect from this summer, when the window will close at 5pm on 1 September. For the past two years the transfer window has shut on the eve of the Premier League season. It was a change instigated by the clubs who felt a later window disrupted their performance at the beginning of the season. It proved unsatisfactory for many clubs, particularly the “big six” who felt the early closure of the window, while other leagues stayed open, left them exposed to having players picked up by European rivals without the opportunity to replace them. Manchester United and Tottenham, in particular, were frustrated at an inability to properly restructure their squads last summer. It was widely known that Spurs wanted to sell Christian Eriksen but were unable to strike a deal during the English window. A fear of losing the player without a replacement then meant a disgruntled Eriksen remained at Tottenham until January, when he moved to Internazionale. The decision to revert to the previous system was made by the Premier League clubs at their regular shareholders’ meeting and was passed by a simple majority vote, a change from the normal procedure whereby any motion must pass with a two-thirds majority. It is understood a third proposal, that would have kept an early end to the window for deals between Premier League clubs, was rejected. The Premier League season will start on 8 August.
