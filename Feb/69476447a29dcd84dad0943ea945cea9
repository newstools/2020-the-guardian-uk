At the age of 69, I tend to hide any feelings of sadness, but on reading the farewell comments of EU cultural figures (Missing you already, 1 February) and in particular Esa-Pekka Salonen’s – that we are leaving “one of the greatest ideas of unity, friendship, liberty and peace” – I cried.Julia MartenCottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire • I’m confused by the Brexit 50p coin that says “Peace, prosperity and friendship to all nations”. Isn’t that what we joined for in the first place?Julia Draper Bath • How fortuitous that the same day Brexit happened the coronavirus hit the UK.
