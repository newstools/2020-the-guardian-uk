You may have come across a family-run hotel, a small ski resort, an idyllic village, a small museum/gallery or fantastic walks off the beaten track. It may have been an interesting shopping street, B&B, neighbourhood brasserie, park or wildlife reserve that took your fancy. Please let us know about trips to places not widely known to visitors – boat rides to quiet islands, local theatres and cinemas … you get the picture. We are not including the UK this time, but anywhere in continental Europe and Ireland is fine. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words, and provide websites (and prices if helpful) and exact locations. Have a look at our past winners and other tips We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. Photographs are very welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text that our judges will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The prize is £200 for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK or Europe. The winner will be chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website and may also appear in print in Guardian Travel.
