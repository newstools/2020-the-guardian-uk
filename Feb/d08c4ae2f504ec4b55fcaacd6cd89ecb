It is only healthy to question the wealth and behaviour of the richest in society, but Simon Jenkins’ position that large-scale philanthropy is merely a guise for the rich to avoid proper taxation, regulation and scrutiny feels counterproductive (Journal, 22 February). The Charities Aid Foundation’s research shows that while fewer people are giving to charity (both in the UK and across the world’s most developed countries), those who do donate are giving more. Attacking those who give away their money risks sending a message to people with a genuine desire to help others and contribute to good causes that their efforts will be met with ridicule and disdain. It’s reasonable to scrutinise how charitable funds are spent, but we shouldn’t assume government is the only vehicle for doing good in our society.John LowChief executive, Charities Aid Foundation • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
