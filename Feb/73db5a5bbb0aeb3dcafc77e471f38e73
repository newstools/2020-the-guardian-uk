We live off-grid on a smallholding in Wales. It has no mains electricity; all power comes from solar panels, and a backup generator for when the sun is scarce. Our water comes from a spring and is treated by filters and a UV light, providing a chemical-free supply. We grow plenty of fruit and vegetables, and have 13 alpacas – we harvest their fleeces once a year to sell. I have been having chemotherapy over the past few years; what started as bowel cancer spread to my lung. I find this is a lovely place to rehabilitate, and couldn’t imagine living in the city and being sick. When I was really ill I’d give myself little goals of venturing out and seeing the alpacas so I could take a little walk in my dressing gown. This way of life makes you realise what you don’t really need. Someone gave us a dishwasher, which we wouldn’t use – it requires far too much energy. We’re living our dream and are no longer in the rat race. We work well together, as we allow each other to just be. My love of nature, plus Rodney’s farming background, meant we had always hankered after a smallholding lifestyle. While our three children were growing up, we were energy-conscious, recycling and cutting out chemicals. When the kids left home, we tired of talking about it and devised our low-carbon lifestyle, leaving city life in Gloucester to raise alpacas. We also hold workshops in fibre spinning and basket weaving. This smallholding provided a perfect opportunity to live off-grid. We installed a wood-fired Rayburn for hot water and heating, meaning BT is the only service we are hooked up to. • If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.
