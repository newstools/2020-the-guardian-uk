Cooking for myself is one of my favourite things. There is no dinner by consensus and no fussy eaters to consider (except myself). I can choose whether to eat just a little or obscene amounts, add extra heat or perhaps lick the plate afterwards. And I can do it all while watching series two of Sex Education on Netflix. When the opportunity arises, I like to make something by foraging in the fridge and the cupboard, and the formula goes a bit like this: something fresh (like mushrooms) with some quick flavour (miso) on toast. Always toast. Prep 5 minCook 10 minServes 1 Light olive oil 1 reasonable hunk ciabatta, halved 1 tsp brown rice miso2 tsp white shiro miso 200g mushrooms – a mixture of wild and chestnut mushrooms, sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 10 chives, very finely sliced First toast the bread. Set a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium to high heat and drizzle a little oil over both sides of the bread. When hot, fry the bread for two to three minutes on each side, until golden, then transfer to a plate. Put the two miso pastes in a small bowl, add two tablespoons of water, mix to combine and set aside. Using the same pan, heat a couple of tablespoons of oil over a medium to high flame and, when hot, add the mushrooms, making sure they all have room to cook. Leave to cook undisturbed for four minutes, until they turn a shade of golden brown, then stir in the garlic and cook for another two minutes. Pour in the miso mixture – be careful, it may splatter – and turn the heat right down. The mixture will quickly bubble up and the liquid frazzle away, and you’ll be left with a thick glaze around the mushrooms. Stir in the chives, then tip the lot on to the ciabatta. Drizzle with a little oil, if you wish, and serve immediately.
