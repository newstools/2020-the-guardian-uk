An American-style school bus has driven past Buckingham Palace with a message on the side appealing for Prince Andrew to answer questions from the FBI about his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The stunt was arranged by the US lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein’s victims. The prince stepped away from royal duties after his disastrous Newsnight interview about his relationship with Epstein. The bus carried large pictures of the prince accompanied by the message: “If you see this man please ask him to call the FBI to answer their questions.” Allred gave an impromptu press conference on the steps of the New York supreme court on Friday. She appealed directly to Andrew to come forward to the FBI and share with them information about what he had seen when spending time with Epstein at his properties in Manhattan and elsewhere. “My clients deserve the truth. They have been denied justice so many times over so many years, and there will be no justice without the truth. And there will be no truth unless Prince Andrew stops hiding from the FBI and from the public. This is unacceptable.” She went on: “I implore you, Prince Andrew. You must do the right thing and stop shaming your family – the Queen, your children. If you have done nothing wrong then just talk to the FBI.” Andrew has so far failed to respond to FBI approaches in the ongoing investigation into Epstein and his abuse of underaged girls. Last month the New York prosecutor in the case, Geoffrey Berman, held a press conference outside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion house and revealed that the prince had to date provided “zero cooperation”. Those claims appear to have prompted anger in Buckingham Palace as sources close to the prince denied that he had been uncooperative. According to sources who spoke to the Guardian, Andrew is “committed to the legal process”.
