When Bonnie met Lozza. Not a corny Hollywood romcom plot but the playwright and critic Bonnie Greer meeting up with the actor Laurence Fox (or “Lozza”, as he prefers to be known) for a coffee and a chat. Not a big deal, you might think. Yet, it’s become a big deal. Fox whipped up a little national storm after his performance on a recent BBC Question Time, in which he branded discussions of racism in Britain as “boring”, and dismissed criticism that he was exhibiting “white privilege” as itself racist. Then, in a podcast with James Delingpole, he condemned the casting of a Sikh soldier in the film 1917 as “institutionally racist” because it was “forcing diversity on people”. (He later apologised for his “clumsy” comments.) All of which turned Fox into either an obnoxious racist or an anti-woke hero, depending on which side of the divide you stood. It’s good to talk. We are going to talk again. Thank you for meeting. @Bonn1eGreer pic.twitter.com/z2KoPKHVF1 Greer is both a campaigner against racism and a defender of free speech. After hearing Greer criticise him on radio, Fox “reached out” to her. The two met at the British Museum, no doubt to chat about racism, wokeness and privilege. So far, so normal. Except apparently it wasn’t. There were newspaper articles and the inevitable Twitter storm. Some hailed Greer as brave. Others branded the meeting as meaningless, even harmful, and condemned Greer for showing “disrespect… [to] the black British arts community”. What’s most extraordinary about this is that Bonnie meeting Lozza should be seen as something extraordinary. Isn’t this what adults do? Meet, have a chat, sort out disagreements? Nothing better expresses the moment in which we live than two consenting adults discussing their differences of opinion over a drink becoming the focus for such public controversy. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist
