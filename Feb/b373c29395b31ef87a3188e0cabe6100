An Italian football referee has been banned from officiating or attending football matches for one year, after headbutting a goalkeeper following a regional league match. Italy’s Ansa news agency reported that on 1 February, Antonio Martiniello sent off Borgo Mogliano keeper Matteo Ciccioli during their home game against Montottone, in the eastern Macerata district. The hosts held on to win 3-1. The goalkeeper headed to the dressing room after the match to seek an explanation, but discovered that Martiniello had more punishment to dish out. The pair faced off in the corridor and the referee headbutted Ciccioli, who was taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Martiniello will be prevented from officiating matches for the next year, and is also banned from entering the facilities of any teams in Italy’s professional, minor and amateur leagues, as well as attending matches involving the Italian national team.The Macerata police chief has said the ban was fully warranted, because Martiniello had failed to set a good example for youngsters.
