Once again this story (Known Windrush victims ‘may be tip of the iceberg’, 10 February) only goes to show the contempt with which this government holds the Windrush generation. I speak with people in Lambeth day in and day out who have had their lives destroyed and human rights disregarded as a result of the government’s callous actions. The least that can be done is to put in place a proper, fit-for-purpose compensation scheme that is easy to access and fairly compensates people who made this country their home. The fact that so few people have been compensated so far, with such insultingly low amounts, only goes to show the long way that this government has to go before it can be trusted to do the right thing by Windrush families.Cllr Sonia WinifredCabinet member for equalities and culture, Lambeth Council, and Windrush campaigner • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
