Most boxers are content to thank their family, team and God when they win a fight. But Tyson Fury is different. Once he had gone through the usual pleasantries after beating Deontay Wilder to win the WBC heavyweight championship on Saturday, he serenaded the Las Vegas crowd with a rendition of Don McLean’s American Pie. Considering he had just gone seven rounds with one of the most fearsome punchers of recent times, Fury put in a remarkably good vocal performance as his fans, who had travelled to Vegas in huge numbers, joined in. Fury chose not to reproduce the full eight-minute album version of the song, but did sing for nearly two minutes before signing off with “Thank you Las Vegas”. Shortly before the rendition, Fury had paid tribute to his opponent, who had previously been undefeated in 43 fights. ‼️ WHAT A NIGHT🇩🇪 Tyson Fury dethroned Wladimir Klitschko in Germany 🇺🇸 Tyson Fury dethroned Deontay Wilder in America. 👏 Amazing Achievement.🏆 WBC Heavyweight Champion Of The WorldL E G E N D#WILDERFURY2 [@Tyson_Fury] pic.twitter.com/hCeqWOLyNi “A big shout out to Deontay Wilder. He came here tonight and he manned up and he really did show the heart of a champion,” said Fury. “I hit him with a clean right that dropped him and he got back up. He is a warrior. He will be back. He will be champion again. But I will say, the king has returned to the top of the throne!”
