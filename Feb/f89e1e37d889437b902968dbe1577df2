13 JanuaryMy wife has just made 18lb of marmalade. She is 77 and I am 78. Which of the three of us will last the longest (Letters, 10 January)?Terry SwannSheffield 15 JanuaryCongratulations to Mr and Mrs Swann (Letters, 13 January) on their optimism in making marmalade at the ages of 77 and 78. I, too, have just made 18lb. I live on my own and shall be 84 next month. Hope triumphant?David HitchinWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire 16 JanuaryAt just 82 years old, after years of delicious homemade Seville orange delight, changed circumstances recently forced the purchase of a single 350g jar of marmalade. Should I be worried or would buying a whole case improve my prospects (Letters, 15 January)?Valerie LewisWantage, Oxfordshire 17 JanuaryMy husband, aged 88, has just made 41lb of marmalade, and he will probably consume it all himself – given the opportunity.Jaqueline FerrierTiverton, Devon 20 JanuaryA mere 77-year-old making a piffling 15lb of marmalade (Letters, 17 January), I accidently sliced into my finger, and as I am on blood thinners and was alone in the house, I did have doubts whether I might not get to the end of the process, or the process might outlive me.Deb MastersPortchester, Portsmouth • I can’t compete in the marmalade-making stakes, but do wonder how much might fit into a 35mm film canister.Patrick WallaceLondon 21 JanuaryMy husband will be 89 in July and I will be 74 in August. We have just booked a cruise to the Azores and Iceland for 2022. We are so busy that we don’t have time to make marmalade.Val HarrisonBirmingham 23 JanuaryThe marmalade correspondence has run its course, surely? Can we now please have jam tomorrow?Adrian BrodkinLondon 24 JanuaryA heartfelt endorsement, from this 85-year-old, of Adrian Brodkin’s plea for jam tomorrow, or at least this year (Letters, 23 January). Our damson tree usually provides fruit for up to 40lb of jam, but last year not a single damson.Betty ClarkeMalvern, Worcestershire 25 JanuaryPlenty of marmalade still hanging around then (Letters, 21 January). My 95-year-old wife has had me (90) slicing orange peel for the last three hours, and we’ve still some left on the shelf from last year’s batch. So why make 18 jars more? Answer: to give away. Marmalade is a wonderful gift for the friend who has everything.W Paul WilkinsonAtherstone, Warwickshire 27 JanuaryFinding it difficult to buy Seville oranges to make marmalade (Letters, 25 January), I’ve switched to buying the concentrated tinned brand, which I find a reasonable substitute as I like to give jars for friends’ birthdays at my local retired men’s club. If asked whether making it or consuming it contributed to my reaching the age of 95, the answer is no – that is, in order of priority, genes, lifestyle and the NHS.Bill MasonBeckenham, Kent 28 JanuaryAt 85, I am still making marmalade (Letters, 27 January), at the only time of the year when I am allowed control of the kitchen. I remain competitive, coming second in the village show in 2019, but after several lean years. However, a jar of my marmalade, unplaced in Suffolk, was taken to Somerset, rebranded, and came first in a WI competition there. A prophet not honoured in his own county perhaps?Alan MackleyBlythburgh, Suffolk 29 JanuaryYou are never too old to make marmalade (Letters, 28 January) and, as founder of the International Marmalade Awards, which have been running for 15 years, I can speak with authority. The very popular “Octogenarians and over” category in the competition receives entries from all over the world. We hope more and more people will make marmalade regardless of their age – and enter a jar or two into our competition in aid of hospice work globally.Jane Hasell-McCoshPenrith, Cumbria 30 JanuaryMy 82-year-old husband is also making marmalade this week (Letters, passim). Can we start an octogenarian Guardian readers marmalade-making club? Sharing tips would be useful.Anne TitleyKington, Herefordshire • I don’t like marmalade. How should I occupy myself in my declining years?Anne CowperLlandeilo Ferwallt, Gower 31 JanuaryRe an octogenarian Guardian readers’ marmalade-making club (Letters, 30 January), could it be called the Preservation Order?Michael CunninghamWolverhampton 1 FebruaryCongratulations on your brave decision to stop taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels (Guardian drops ads from fossil fuel companies, 30 January). Greenpeace calls for others to follow suit, prompting this marmalade consumer (who merely adds the labels to his wife’s confection) to triple his admittedly tiny subscription to your inspiring newspaper.David YatesEccles, Greater Manchester • Can I join the search to find the oldest marmalade-making Guardian readers (Letters, 31 January)? At 92 and a half, I have just made enough marmalade to last a year – with help in lifting a heavy jam pan! I use a family recipe older than me, originating in 1926 with a master baker in Cinderford.Elizabeth GreenBrockenhurst, Hampshire • Forget printing articles about “wellness”. It seems that marmalade holds the key to a long, healthy life.Pat WakelingNottingham 4 FebruaryIt’s about 45 years ago since the Guardian last ran a lengthy correspondence on growing loofahs (Letters, 1 February). We tried to grow them at the time on our bathroom windowsill but only produced fruit the size of small gherkins – a horticultural triumph but useless for washing purposes. I wonder if global warming would make it worth our while to repeat the experiment? And might loofahs perhaps replace marmalade as your next topic thread?Jane McAdooLondon 5 FebruaryI had a serious head injury a year ago and was told that, among other things, it might have an effect on my taste buds. It has where marmalade is concerned (Letters, 1 February). I used to love it – the chunkier and more bitter the better. Now I hate it. What on earth can I put on my toast? / What I loved I now hate the most. / January won’t be the same. / When the pan doesn’t boil o’er the flame.Elizabeth EarlWinsham, Somerset 6 FebruaryMay I, a 95-year-old, second-generation Guardian reader, join the marmalade marathon (Letters, 5 February). This year I have made 6lb of grapefruit marmalade and 20lb of Seville orange. I hope to live to enjoy it all!Joy NalpanisReading, Berkshire • I have never made marmalade. But I still do create jams/chutneys for my friends. To keep them on their toes, I also write the labels. “Rosepetal and Earwig” was a favourite!Yvonne MalikWray, Lancashire 7 FebruaryI’m very glad that Jane McAdoo remembers the Great Guardian Diary Loofahs from all those years ago (Letters, 4 February). I still have them: one skinned, one unskinned. They don’t get a lot of use now but are often admired. Until the seeds finally worked their way out, the unskinned one was also a handy rattle/baby distracter. My wife and I have interrupted our marmalade-making to send this.Martin Wainwright(Guardian Diary editor in the good old loofah days) Thrupp, Oxfordshire • Atrophied (Wordwheel, G2, 4 February)? This 88-year-old made Aphrodite (and marmalade).Judith BennettSturminster Newton, Dorset 8 FebruaryMy dear husband, who at 80-plus makes delicious marmalade (Letters, 7 February), has just labelled this year’s batch “The Last Hurrah”. Oh dear.Hazel HarrisonNorwich • Join the discussion – send your letters about marmalade (or any other subject) to guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read the latest the Guardian letters – visit gu.com/letters
