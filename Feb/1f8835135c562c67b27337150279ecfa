Richard Masters’ attempt to defend the presence of gambling company logos on football shirts (New Premier League chief says betting sponsorship will continue, 5 February) is nothing less than an own goal. It is hopelessly out of touch with grassroots supporters of football and the general public, who have had enough of unprecedented gambling adverts. Even the gambling industry is thinking again after GVC boss Kenny Alexander admitted the public feel bombarded by ads like pitch-side banners and logos on shirts. In my own patch, Luton Town FC has taken a principled stance, always resisting gambling money because they see themselves as a family club and core to the community. The Premier League needs to wake up to the fact the public are tired of the constant gamblification of the beautiful game. More and more children can match gambling company logos with football clubs. Yet firms are meant to advertise only to adults, to protect children from potential harm. Those with long memories will remember the battles fought over tobacco money in sport, which has direct similarities with the current state of affairs. But one thing is true – even when the ads dry up, and their money stops, sport thrives due to the support of ordinary people.Rt Rev Dr Alan SmithBishop of St Albans • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
