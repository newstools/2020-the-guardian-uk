Henry Slade will join his England teammates for the first time in this year’s Six Nations as he steps up his recovery from an ankle problem. Slade sustained the injury in Exeter’s 31-22 Premiership victory at Leicester in mid-December, forcing him to miss the opening two rounds of the championship. A statement released by England said Slade and Manu Tuilagi will continue their rehabilitation when they meet a 25-man squad for a three-day camp in Kensington. Tuilagi sustained a groin strain in the 24-17 defeat by France that launched the campaign in deflating fashion, forcing him to sit out the Calcutta Cup victory against Scotland on Saturday. It was hoped he would miss only one game, but his absence from the 25-strong group named by Eddie Jones suggests he also faces a race against time to be fit for Ireland’s visit to Twickenham on Sunday week. Slade is an alternative to Tuilagi at outside-centre but the match against Andy Farrell’s unbeaten team may also arrive too soon for him, pointing to Jonathan Joseph’s retention in the No 13 jersey. Courtney Lawes was involved against France and Scotland but has been rested for the camp that begins on Thursday. The Sale centre Cameron Redpath has also been summoned in addition to the 25.
