The Cleveland Browns’ star defensive end, Myles Garrett, has been reinstated by the NFL. He was suspended from the league indefinitely in November for hitting Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph over the head with a helmet. Garrett missed Cleveland’s final six games last season after his attack on Rudolph in the closing seconds of a game on 14 November that was nationally televised. Garrett’s loss was a major blow to the Browns, who went 2-4 without him, finished 6-10, fired coach Freddie Kitchens and saw general manager John Dorsey resign. Garrett has expressed remorse over the incident and on Monday he met with the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, in New York. “We welcome Myles back to our organization with open arms,” Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. “We know he is grateful to be reinstated, eager to put the past behind him and continue to evolve and grow as a leader. We look forward to having his strong positive presence back as a teammate, player and person in our community.” Garrett’s tangle with Rudolph occurred as the Browns were wrapping up a rare win over the Steelers. He pulled down Rudolph after a pass attempt and the two wrestled on the ground. Garrett ripped off Rudolph’s helmet and swung and struck him with it, triggering a brawl between the teams. Garrett later accused Rudolph of aiming a racial slur at him, an allegation the Steelers quarterback has vehemently denied.
