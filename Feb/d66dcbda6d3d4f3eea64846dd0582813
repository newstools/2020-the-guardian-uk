The former Australia and Yorkshire coach Darren Lehmann will undergo heart bypass surgery this week after being admitted to hospital with chest pains, Cricket Australia has announced. Lehmann, who was on the Gold Coast to watch his son Jake captain the Cricket Australia XI against the touring England Lions, was taken to hospital in Brisbane on his 50th birthday. “Former Australia batsman and coach Darren Lehmann will undergo bypass surgery on Saturday after suffering chest pains on the Gold Coast today,” Cricket Australia said on its website. Lehmann was appointed to Cricket Australia’s national performance programme in Brisbane after resigning as the head coach in May 2018 saying he was “ultimately responsible for the culture of the team” after the ball-tampering scandal. Recently he coached Brisbane Heat in the 2019 Big Bash League. Lehmann, also a former Yorkshire player and coach, was appointed coach of the Headingley-based The Hundred side Northern Superchargers in the summer. “I would like to thank everyone in the Australian cricket family for their concern,” Lehmann is quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “I am receiving the best of medical care and am confident I’ll be back on my feet soon.” Lehmann was treated in hospital for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in January 2016 when he was coach of Australia. Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon said: “We’re shocked by the news. He’s been a great servant for Yorkshire County Cricket Club over the years and we wish both him and his family well in the coming weeks.” Lehmann was Yorkshire’s overseas player from 1997 to 2006 and helped them to their first County Championship title in 33 years in 2001.
