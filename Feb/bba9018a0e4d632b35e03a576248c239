A standard poodle named Siba is America‚Äôs top canine after earning the title of best in show on Tuesday night at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Judge Bob Slay chose the three-year-old black poodle despite the Madison Square Garden audience‚Äôs vocal appeals for Daniel, a crowd-pleaser looking to become the first golden retriever to claim the highest prize in the 144-year history of the country‚Äôs most prestigious dog show. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs beautiful and has that something,‚Äù handler Chrystal Murray-Clas said. BEST. IN. SHOW. ü•áSiba the Standard Poodle claims the top honor at the #WKCDogShow! It is the 5th win for the breed, good for fourth-most all-time. pic.twitter.com/OYBCtTcwnr The poised three-year-old from Pennsylvania with the shiny jet-black coat, elaborate coifs and shaved behind, whose official champion‚Äôs name is Stone Run Afternoon Tea, was the last dog standing after a winnowing-down process that began on Monday morning with more than 2,600 entries in 204 breeds and varieties hailing from 49 different states and 19 other countries. She moved effortlessly and elegantly around the ring to capture the crown over a stacked field of six other group winners, among them a whippet named Bourbon (awarded reserve best in show) and Daniel, whose name was chanted throughout the arena as the judge made his final assessment. Others in the final best-of-seven ring included havanese named Bono, a shetland sheepdog named Conrad, a wire fox terrier named Vinny and a boxer named Wilma, who won the working group for a second consecutive year only to again be pipped at the final hurdle. A whirlwind media blitz on Wednesday looms, including a series of apperances on the morning chat shows, a photo op atop the Empire State Building, the traditional steak lunch at Sardi‚Äôs and, possibly, a walk-on part in the Broadway musical Beetlejuice.
