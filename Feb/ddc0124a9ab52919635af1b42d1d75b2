Jason Byrne at Latitude festival in 2011: he had the audience in the palm of his hand. He was walking the line between a comedy gig and a riot. I loved This Is Going to Hurt by Adam Kay. The funnies are so natural, and the pathos that is squeezed in between amplifies them further. In my last show, I asked an audience that included my parents if anyone had read Fifty Shades of Grey. I said: “I’m glad my mum didn’t cheer,” to which my dad stood up and said: “She doesn’t need to read it, son, she’s fucking living it.” I’ve never had an audience laugh so hard since. I have a T-shirt that says: “Does it Look Like I Fly Economy?” I find it utterly hilarious. Everyone else in Economy rolls their eyes (I expect, I can’t see them from First! … I’m joking, I promise!). The three years of long, straightened emo fringe I rocked is pretty hilarious in hindsight. The dream of wanting to be a comedian and have a steady income for years to come.
