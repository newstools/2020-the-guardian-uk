The Scotland prop Allan Dell expects Eddie Jones to pick his words more wisely before Saturday’s Calcutta Cup game after seeing the England coach’s latest pre-match barbs spectacularly backfire in Paris. Jones warned France’s new-look side to prepare for a level of “brutality” and “violence” they have never experienced before in the build-up to Sunday’s Six Nations meeting. But instead it was a youthful Les Bleus side who dished out lessons in physicality as they dominated Jones’ men in a one-sided 24-17 triumph. Jones’s words may not have done his team any favours but Dell is a fan of the outspoken Australian. The prop even likened him to the outspoken football manager José Mourinho and believes his tactics pay off more than they fail. “You’d assume [England will be angry], especially after what Eddie’s been saying in the media,” said Dell. “I don’t think he did his players much justice throwing them out there to that. They’re a team full of pride with players who have achieved a lot, so they’ll be hurting. “They’re coming here to make a statement having not beaten us for two years. Eddie, I know, will be in their ears. He’s a smart man and he will be hyping them up the right way. “I don’t think he has too much to say. Look at football and how José Mourinho used to do it. I think he’s very sharp in that way. He takes the focus away from his team and lets them get on with what they need to do and he lets the media get on to him. That’s fantastic for a manager to do but sometimes it backfires.” Dell admits some within his camp had been hoping Jones’s team had made a winning start. “What does a wounded animal do when it’s backed up in the corner?” he asked. “It attacks you. A few of the boys were saying they hoped England would smash France and come here and underestimate us. They will have a point to prove now.”
