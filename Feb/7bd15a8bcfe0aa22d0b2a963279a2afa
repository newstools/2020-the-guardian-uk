I am 62 and have only just reached the “marmalade years” (The preserve of a long life, G2, 10 February), but I hope your readers enjoy my marmalade poem: I am turning into somebody elsesomebody who makes marmalade.Somebody who rolls a cool thick Sevilleagainst her cheek breathing in the smell of Spainin the dusk of Devon.Somebody who cuts thin peelskimming golden frothfrom amber soupin a January kitchen.When did this happen?Watching the teaspoon for the set,boiling the jarswriting tidy labels.I should be wearinga white dressgazing up through blossomat a Spanish blue skybiting into olive flesh,and running my fingersalong red wallswarm with secretsinstead of lining upnine jars of sun. (First published in Exclamat!on Vol 1 and Moor Poets Vol IV)Helen ScaddingDartington, Devon • Clearly I’m not yet in my marmalade years. I proudly took a jar my partner and I had made to my 90-year-old marmalade-producing dad as a gift on Saturday. On Sunday morning I got up to find him “improving” the jar’s contents by reboiling it in a saucepan. Later I found the gift back in its jar and in my bag ready to be taken home. Those born between the wars may well have the edge on marmalade producing. I’m not so sure about manners.

We needed to as she consumes up to a jar a week, and my sister can’t keep her supplied. I think that is evidence for marmalade contributing to longevity. That and sloe gin.Clare RonaldRiec sur Belon, France • Exactly 50 years ago, the song Reflections of my Life was a top 10 hit for the pop group Marmalade.Steve MooreLeumeah, New South Wales, Australia
