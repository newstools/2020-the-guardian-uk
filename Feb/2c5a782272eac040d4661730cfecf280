Kansas City Chiefs fans waiting in freezing temperatures for their team’s Super Bowl victory parade got some unexpected action on Tuesday. A police chase was played out on streets that had been closed for the parade as fans watched. Showcasing some of the elusiveness that Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had used to evade the San Francisco 49ers pass rushers on Sunday, the car managed to escape police when seemingly surrounded. Law enforcement then used spikes on the road and the PIT maneuver, in which a car is hit in the rear causing the driver to swerve and lose control, to end the chase as fans cheered officers. The incident happened a few hours before the scheduled start of the parade but hundreds of fans had already gathered and there would almost certainly have been casualties if any of the cars had lost control and entered the crowd. Two suspects have been taken into custody. Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas ruled out any suspicions the incident had been terrorism related and said that one of the pair had been impaired and had been on a “joy ride”.

They beat the 49ers 31-20 in Miami on Sunday after a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback. An estimated 800,000 people attended the victory parade when the city’s baseball team, the Royals, won the World Series in 2015.
