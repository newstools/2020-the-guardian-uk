There’s something uniquely dispiriting about a film that manages to waste the considerable talents of almost everybody involved, both in front of and behind the camera. Director Miguel Arteta, who brought a bracingly transgressive tartness to indie comedies Chuck & Buck and The Good Girl, delivers sloppily paced hack work here, while Tiffany Haddish and Rose Byrne, two fine comic actresses, are shackled to a screenplay so crassly tone-deaf, it makes you want to chisel off your own ears. Haddish and Byrne play Mia and Mel respectively, childhood friends who realised their dream of starting a cosmetics company together, but are pitted against each other when they are bought out by uber-bitch billionaire businesswoman Claire Luna (Salma Hayek). A nagging score flags up the spaces where the jokes should be. The one redeeming feature is Billy Porter, playing Mia and Mel’s employee Barrett, whose “tragic moment” of fabulous melodrama is more fun than everything else in the movie put together.
