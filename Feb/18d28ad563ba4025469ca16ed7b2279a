1) Sportâ€™s easier with the wind on your side. Witness Justin Gatlin mauling Usain Boltâ€™s 100m world record with a run of 9.45secs â€¦ albeit with a massive fan behind him for a Japanese TV show, raising the wind reading to 8.9 m/s. Thatâ€™s almost four and a half times the legal limit (for comparison, Boltâ€™s mark of 9.58 was set with a wind of 0.9 m/s behind him). Speaking of 100m, thatâ€™s the distance Barrowâ€™s Jamie Dallimore managed with a goalline drop-out in the Challenge Cup with assistance from Storm Dennis behind him. It left London Skolars having to drop out themselves, in the other direction (spoilers: theirs didnâ€™t go 100m) â€¦ Back to athletics, various competitors enjoyed a stiff breeze behind them, with triple jumpers Willie Banks (1988, 18.06m) and Jonathan Edwards (1995, 18.43m), while Carl Lewis threw in a wind-assisted 8.91m before Mike Powell replied with something longer and more legal in the greatest long jump competition of all time at the 1991 world championships. Arbroathâ€™s Colin Hamilton used the elements to put Roberto Carlos-like whip on a corner â€“ however the match against Ayr was abandoned at half-time with the scores at 1-1 due to the high winds. More wicked dead-ball curl too from Blyth Spartansâ€™ Robbie Dale. A gust caught this 2018 clearance from Thurrockâ€™s Kamarl Duncan, resulting in him scoring a 40-yard own goal despite kicking the ball away from goal. Always follow up, as Portadown FCâ€™s Chris Lavery highlights against Queenâ€™s University. And ballboys of Wales: keep an eye on your chair, particularly if itâ€™s of the plastic garden variety. ðŸ¤£ Y gwynt yn chwarae ei ran!

Both of one teamâ€™s goaltenders depart injured. Man in stands gets summoned, has name hastily ironed on to back of jersey, ends up in goal â€¦ and saves eight out of 10 shots to help his side to victory. If this doesnâ€™t get you, reader, sport is probably not for you. Pure, pure poetry (and swearing) embroils David Ayres, Carolina Hurricanesâ€™ newest hero. 3) Toning down your celebrations against former colleagues is not a thing at Miembeni in Zanzibar, as coach Mani Gamera lands a fine and six-month suspension following groin and Y-front-highlighting antics in front of Jangâ€™ombe supporters. 4) Putt of the week: this, from 94 feet across a basketball court to win a car for 84-year-old Mary Ann Wakefield. Thereâ€™s a host of markedly less kind lies to be seen in this compilation from the last decade. 5) Meanwhile in North Macedonia â€¦ a player gets his marching orders after dispossessing an opponent using a spare ball. 6) On this day corner: 21 years ago â€“ Aston Villa fielded the last all-English XI in the Premier League, and got ripped to bits by Coventry. James Beattie turns 42 today, and kicks off this splendid package of Southampton long-range pearlers. Jonjo Shelvey is now 28 â€“ here he his is not quite getting to Kevin De Bruyne earlier in the season but atoning in kind to give Newcastle a point. Todd Cantwell turns 22, and was another to put a spanner in Manchester Cityâ€™s plans to retain their title. 1) In 1977, back in the days of 15-round heavyweight title fights, Muhammad Ali and Earnie Shavers went the distance, culminating in an exhausting, brutal final round. 2) Jon Rahm hits 61 in Mexico, including a one-bounce hole in one.
