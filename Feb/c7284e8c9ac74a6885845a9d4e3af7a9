No 10’s attempted selective press briefing policy (Report, 5 February) is laughable and frightening. Laughable in a Death of Stalin sense, smacking of a politburo bunker mentality, and pretending the “truth” can only be handled by tame lackeys. Chilling as a crude threat to democracy in this new “golden age”, where any semblance of much-vaunted “transparency” has been thrown overboard. It makes a mockery of Boris Johnson’s promises to unite the country, and underlines the hollowness of whatever emerges from his oral cavity.Ian BartlettEast Molesey, Surrey • If banning John Crace from Boris Johnson’s media shows produces such astute and witty comment pieces (Sketch, 4 February), Classic Dom has scored a perfect own goal!John WarburtonEdinburgh • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
