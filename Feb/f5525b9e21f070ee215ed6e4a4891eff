Chelsea have reached an agreement in principle with Ajax to sign Hakim Ziyech at the end of the season for €40m (£33.6m) plus add-ons. Frank Lampard is driving the pursuit of the 26-year-old Morocco winger as the manager looks to reshape Chelsea’s attacking options. The club will allow Pedro to leave on a free in the summer and the future of 31-year-old Willian, who will also be out of contract, is unclear because he wants more than the one-year deal on offer. Lampard’s other options in wide areas are Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Ziyech, who joined Ajax from Twente in 2016, plays on the right but can drift inside and make an extra man in midfield, as Chelsea and Tottenham have discovered in the Champions League. Chelsea tried to sign Ziyech in January but Ajax were unwilling to sanction a sale mid-season as they chase the Dutch title and hope to progress in the Europa League. Tottenham had been interested in Ziyech but signed Steven Bergwijn in January.
