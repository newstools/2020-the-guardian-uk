An “emotional affair” is distinguished by a betrayal or breach of a romantic relationship without physical intimacy. It may mean spending time with someone – perhaps a friend, colleague or ex – and not disclosing it to your current partner, who you know would find it hurtful. You may confide in them where you don’t your partner, potentially about your current relationship. It may or may not lead to physical intimacy, or the end of your relationship. We are looking to hear from people who have experience of an emotional affair, whether it was your emotional affair or your partner’s. We would like to know how and why the emotional affair arose and what impact it had on your relationship. Featured interviewees would be given the option to be anonymous.
