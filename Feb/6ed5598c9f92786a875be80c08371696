Earlier this month, John Lewis announced it would permanently stock a men’s makeup line – War Paint for Men – in its Oxford Street store and online after sales exceeded expectations by more than 50% in a month-long trial. It’s not the first makeup brand for men; Tom Ford, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel also sell male cosmetics, and some forecasters predict that one in four men will use some type of makeup within five years. We’d like to hear from men who wear cosmetics about their experiences. Are you a man who wears makeup? We would like to hear about your experiences, and the reasons why you decided to start wearing cosmetics. Do people notice you are wearing makeup? How do they react? And has wearing makeup changed your perceptions of beauty, wellbeing or masculinity? We’d love to see any selfies or pictures you’ve taken.
