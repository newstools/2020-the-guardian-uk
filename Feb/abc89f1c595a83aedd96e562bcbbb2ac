The first banknote launched under Johnson’s government features Turner’s symbolic Fighting Temeraire (Money, 20 February; Steve Bell cartoon, 21 February). Did nobody at the Bank of England notice its full title: “The Fighting Temeraire, tugged to her last berth to be broken up”?Clare Addison Marston, Oxford • So, five pictures of Dominic Cummings and one of Thatcher in the main section of Saturday’s paper. For goodness sake, this is not a start to the weekend that I want. Get a grip.Ian CharltonWakefield, West Yorkshire • Could you print more photos of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings and Priti Patel, please? Our cat likes to express her opinion of these charlatans by having their pictures underneath her litter tray.Colin HerbertWimbledon Park, London • We’ve had enough of marmalade conversations by now (Letters, 22 February).
