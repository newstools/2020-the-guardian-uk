The biscuits of my youth – bourbons, custard creams and digestives – were crisp, smooth and crunchy until America arrived in my life some time in my teens. Then, everything changed. I spent Friday nights watching Friends, I listened to NWA on my Sony Walkman, wore tie-dye T-shirts and drank ‘thick shakes’. Crucially, when it came to biscuits, crisp was most definitely out and big, soft and chewy cookies were in. They made quite the impression and, if I’m honest, never really left – I am still a cookie-lover, so I thought it about time I wrote a recipe for this American classic. Prep 10 minRest 30 minCook 25 minMakes 16 200g plain flour¾ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda½ tsp sea salt, crumbled150g golden caster sugar125g 70% dark chocolate85ml sunflower oil – I like Mr Organic2 tsp vanilla extract Put the flour, baking powder, bicarb, salt and sugar in a large bowl and mix well. Break the chocolate into little chunks, add these to the bowl and mix again. In a small bowl, briskly whisk the oil, vanilla extract and four tablespoons of water, until emulsified. Pour the liquids into the dry ingredients, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together into a batter, then pop the bowl in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line two large oven trays with baking paper. Using a small scoop – for example a tablespoon measuring spoon – spoon the cookie dough on to the sheet, spacing the rounds 10cm apart, because they’ll spread. (If you don’t have a suitable scoop, gently roll the dough with your hands into balls the size of ping-pong balls and weighing about 40g each.) Bake for 12 minutes, or until the cookies have a crisp, golden edge and are not wobbly to the touch in the centre. Leave to cool completely on the trays before eating. Store any leftovers (as if!) in an airtight container.
