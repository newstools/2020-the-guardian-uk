At least eight people have been killed and five others seriously injured in two shootings at shisha bars in the German town of Hanau, according to local police. The public prosecutor’s office confirmed that eight people were killed in attacks in the town near Frankfurt, according to the local paper Hessenschau. Local police initially said that five people had been seriously injured, but later confirmed that eight people were “fatally wounded” and a major operation had been launched. According to police and local media, at least one of the victims was seriously injured at around 10pm local time when eight or nine shots were fired at the “Midnight” shisha bar on Heumarkt in the centre of the town. A dark vehicle was seen leaving the scene. Soon afterwards, shots were fired at a second shisha bar – the Arena Bar & Café in Kurt-Schumacher-Platzin the western Kesselstadt district – where at least five people were very seriously injured. Initial reports of a third incident in the district of Lamboy were denied by police. According to Bild newspaper, police have arrested one suspect. It is unclear how many suspects were involved overall. Police said on Wednesday night they had no confirmed information on the background of the two attacks and appealed for witnesses to come forward. There was no detail about the possible motive. Hanau, which sits in southwestern Germany, about 20 km (12 miles) east of Frankfurt, has a population of about 100,000. Reports of the shooting come just days after one person was shot dead and four more were injured outside a Berlin music venue. The shooting in the German capital occurred last Friday near the Tempodrome, which was hosting a Turkish comedy show on the night. The motives behind the Berlin attack have remained unclear.
