Players would soon learn alternative ways of controlling the ball.Toby WoodPeterborough, Cambridgeshire • For 40 happy years, we have honoured our unwritten marriage contract. Every January my wife presents me with jars of homemade marmalade. Each summer I repay her with bouquets of homegrown sweet peas from our garden.William AlexanderSevenoaks, Kent • My delight at the iconoclasm and unfettered imagination of Steve Bell’s cartoon (26 February) was hugely enhanced by noticing it was his 69th birthday.
