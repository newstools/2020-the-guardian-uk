Johnny Sexton believes Andy and Owen Farrell each possess an admirable ability to set aside their father-son relationship when it comes to a high-stakes match. The Farrells will be in opposite camps on Sunday when Ireland play England at Twickenham. Andy Farrell will hope to see his team clinch the triple crown to remain on course for a grand slam, while Owen Farrell is bidding to help keep alive England’s title challenge. Sexton has seen the pair working together on tour with the British and Irish Lions and fully anticipates their business-like approach. “On Lions tours when they’ve been together as father and son, you’d never have guessed it,” the Ireland fly-half and captain said. “They’re very close but when they’re in a professional environment on the same team it’s just like a player with any coach. “I admired that about them and it’s the same when they’re opposing. They’re very professional and it’s just like playing against any other team really.” Farrell Sr has previously faced Saracens fly-half Farrell as part of Ireland’s management team but will be doing so for the first time since replacing Joe Schmidt as coach. Asked if Farrell Sr had been able to outline any flaws in his son’s game, Sexton replied: “He doesn’t have too many weaknesses really. If he was crap that could be a different story and he could be telling us all his weaknesses. But he’s a world-class player, so it’s more his strengths that we’ve looked at. We’ve all played against him numerous times and we know the type of player he is and how good he is, so we’re just preparing for his strengths.” Ireland, who began the tournament with Dublin wins over Scotland and Wales, initially opted for an unchanged starting XV before their plans were altered by the birth of Iain Henderson’s son. The absence of the Ulster lock paves the way for Devin Toner to come into the second row and make his first start since his shock omission from Ireland’s World Cup squad.
