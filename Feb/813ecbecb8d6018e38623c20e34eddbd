Two West Ham fans have been arrested for allegedly making homophobic gestures towards Brighton supporters during Saturday’s draw at the London Stadium. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed the pair were released under investigation following the Premier League fixture, which ended 3-3 after a late Brighton comeback. “Two male West Ham fans were arrested on suspicion of making homophobic gestures,” a Metropolitan Police spokesperson told BBC Sport. “One male (also a West Ham fan) was arrested on suspicion of common assault. The incident is the latest to blight English football this season, with two fans ejected from Brighton’s home draw with Chelsea on New Year’s Day for homophobic abuse. West Ham have vowed to ban anyone found guilty for life. “West Ham United is disgusted to hear of alleged homophobic incidents at the game against Brighton & Hove Albion,” said a spokesperson. “The matter is now with the police but anyone found guilty of acting in a discriminatory manner will be banned for life from London Stadium and from travelling with the club. “The club is unequivocal in its stance - we have a zero-tolerance approach to any form of discrimination. Equality and diversity is at the heart of the football club and we are committed to continue ensuring that everyone who enters London Stadium is free to enjoy watching their team play football in an inclusive environment.”
