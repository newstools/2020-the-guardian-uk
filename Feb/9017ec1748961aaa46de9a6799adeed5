Second-half goals by Lynn Williams, Lindsey Horan and Megan Rapinoe helped the US women’s national team win the Concacaf qualifying tournament for the 2020 Olympics by defeating Canada 3-0 in the final on Sunday. Williams put the US ahead in the 60th minute, marking the first goal allowed by the Canadians in the five-game tournament. Horan extended the lead in the 71st and Williams set up Rapinoe in the 87th. Alyssa Naeher made three saves as the US outscored the opposition 24-0 over the tournament. TWO DEFENDERS? @LindseyHoran SAID EXCUSE ME! pic.twitter.com/Cbleuelz5D Both teams had already qualified for this summer’s Olympics through their semi-final wins on Friday. The Americans, who have won 25 of their past 28 games, have never lost a regional Olympic qualifier. The US have participated in six Olympics, winning four gold medals (1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012) and a silver in 2000, but were eliminated in the 2016 semi-finals by Sweden. Canada were bronze medalists in 2012 and 2016. Each team had good chances in the first half. Christen Press hit the crossbar in the 33rd minute and soon after she missed an open goal from 30 yards out. Canada’s Christine Sinclair, who had three qualifier goals and is the all-time leader in international goals with 186, got behind the US defense and forced a save by Naeher in the 39th minute.

Horan scored her sixth goal in the tournament after a strong build-up. Samantha Mewis sent a cross into the box where Williams knocked the ball down to Horan for the goal. Rapinoe got her 51st career goal for her country by finishing a through ball from Williams, who had four assists in the qualifiers.
