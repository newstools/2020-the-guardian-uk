Jemma Reekie has continued her incredible record-breaking run by smashing the British indoor mile and indoor 1500m records at the Millrose Games in New York – just a week after she claimed the national 800m record. The 21-year-old from Scotland ran the Wanamaker Mile in 4 minutes 17.88 seconds to take nearly a second off the time set by her training partner Laura Muir last year. 1⃣ British record clearly not enough for the on 🔥🔥🔥 @JemmaReekie as she sets 2⃣ more at @MillroseGames 🇬🇧 Women's mile record 4:17.88 for third in New York🇬🇧 Women's 1500m record after going through in 4:00.56😲🙌😲🙌💪 pic.twitter.com/pVmo2DAwQ0 Astonishingly, while Reekie’s time was the fifth-fastest indoor mile in history it was only good enough for third place in the race, which was won by Elle Purrier in an American record of 4:16.85. The German Konstanze Klosterhalfen was second, also with a national record of 4:17.26. Afterwards Reekie, who also ran the first 1500m in 4:00.56 to set another British record, admitted she had no idea that she had done so well. “I actually phoned my coach [Andy Young] and said, ‘is that OK?’ I had no clue of what a good mile time was,” she said. “But yeah, it’s a new British record, so I’m really pleased that I’ve realised that’s what happened.” Reekie admitted she had gained enormous confidence from her 800m record in 1min 57.91sec in Glasgow a week ago – which was also the fastest time indoors by a woman since 2006 and the 11th quickest in history. “After running 1:57 I was like, ‘woah’, can I do that again?” she added. “I’m getting more confident. I tell myself, you deserve to be on this start line. I’m not a junior any more, I’m not an under-23 any more, I need to step up to be a senior.” There have been questions over whether Reekie is being given an unfair advantage by Nike’s new spikes. However last week her coach Andy Young told the Guardian that her shoes were legal and would be in the shops shortly. “It’s a normal looking spike and it is due to market,” he said. “So Jemma’s spike will meet the new regulations in terms of plates and millimetres of foam.” Meanwhile, the performance of the weekend came from the Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, who cleared 6.17m in Torun, Poland to surpass the previous world record set by Renaud Lavillenie in 2014. Duplantis, who only turned 20 three months ago, admitted afterwards: “I don’t think everything has sunk in, I feel like I’m hallucinating.”
