Justin Bieber has broken a US chart record set by Elvis Presley 59 years ago, by becoming the youngest artist to score seven No 1 albums. Bieber, 25, has topped the chart with his album Changes, beating Elvis, whose seventh album Blue Hawaii was released when he was 26, in 1961. Bieber first topped the chart in 2010 aged 16, with his debut album My World 2.0. His four subsequent studio albums, and two out of three of his remix or acoustic albums, have all also reached US No 1. Bieber is also at the top of this week’s R&B and country songs charts. In the UK, he has topped the album chart twice, with Changes and 2012’s Believe, though he has had seven UK No 1 singles. Switching to a more downbeat R&B sound compared with the uptempo pop of his previous work, Changes comes after a period of self-reflection in which Bieber got married and addressed substance misuse issues. The album has received mixed reviews, with the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis calling it “subdued and unassuming, which are curious things for mainstream pop to be”.
