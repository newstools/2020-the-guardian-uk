As Europeans dedicated to promoting international law, peace and security worldwide, we express our deep concern about President Trump’s Middle East plan, titled Peace to Prosperity. The plan contradicts internationally agreed parameters for the Middle East peace process, relevant UN resolutions, including security council resolution 2334, and the most fundamental principles of international law. Instead of promoting peace, it risks fuelling the conflict – at the expense of Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike, and with grave implications for Jordan and the wider region. It has been met with widespread opposition in the region, in Europe, and in the United States. The plan allows for annexation of large and vital parts of the occupied Palestinian territory and legitimises and encourages illegal Israeli settlement activity. It recognises only one side’s claims to Jerusalem and offers no just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees. It projects a future Palestinian “state” without control and sovereignty over its fragmented territory. The map featured in the plan proposes Palestinian enclaves under permanent Israeli military control, which evoke chilling associations with South Africa’s bantustans. Peace to Prosperity is not a roadmap to a viable two-state solution, nor to any other legitimate solution to the conflict. The plan envisages a formalisation of the current reality in the occupied Palestinian territory, in which two peoples are living side by side without equal rights. Such an outcome has characteristics similar to apartheid – a term we don’t use lightly. The international community, particularly the European Union, must prevent such a scenario from unfolding, in order to preserve the dignity and rights of the Palestinians, the future of Israeli democracy and the wider international rules-based order. We welcome the statement by EU high representative Josep Borrell stressing the EU’s continued commitment to a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, in accordance with the international parameters. We fully agree with the EU that Israeli “steps towards annexation, if implemented, could not pass unchallenged”, as they would impair the fundamental international norm banning the acquisition of territory by force. Considering the urgency of the situation, we call on Europe to reject the US plan as a basis for negotiations and to take immediate and effective steps to counter the threat of annexation – and thereby preserve the international rules-based order.Douglas Alexander Former minister of state for Europe and secretary of state for international development, United KingdomBen Bradshaw Former minister of state for the Middle East, United KingdomGro Harlem Brundtland Former prime minister, NorwayJohn Bruton Former prime minister, IrelandMicheline Calmy-Rey Former foreign minister and president, SwitzerlandIngvar Carlsson Former prime minister, SwedenWłodzimierz Cimoszewicz Former foreign minister and prime minister, PolandDaniel Cohn-Bendit Former co-president of the Greens-European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament, GermanyJoe Costello Former minister of state for trade and development and chair of the European affairs committee, IrelandWilly Claes Former foreign minister and Nato secretary general, BelgiumMassimo d’Alema Former foreign minister and prime minister, ItalyTeresa Patrício de Gouveia Former foreign minister, PortugalDominique de Villepin Former foreign minister and prime minister, FranceRuth Dreifuss Former foreign minister and president, SwitzerlandAlan Duncan Former minister of state for Europe and the Americas, and minister of state for international development, United KingdomEspen Barth Eide Former foreign minister, NorwayJan Eliasson Former foreign minister and UN general assembly president, SwedenUffe Ellemann-Jensen Former foreign minister and president of the European Liberals, DenmarkBenita Ferrero-Waldner Former foreign minister and European commissioner for external relations, AustriaSigmar Gabriel Former foreign minister and vice-chancellor, GermanyPeter Hain Former minister of state for the Middle East, United KingdomLena Hjelm-Wallén Former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, SwedenTrinidad Jiménez Former foreign minister, SpainTom Kitt Former minister of state for overseas development and human rights, IrelandBert Koenders Former foreign minister, the NetherlandsMartin Liedegaard Former foreign minister, DenmarkMogens Lykketoft Former foreign minister and UN general assembly president, DenmarkSven Mikser Former foreign minister, EstoniaPer Stig Møller Former foreign minister, DenmarkHolger K Nielsen Former foreign minister, DenmarkAndrzej Olechowski Former foreign minister, PolandMarc Otte Former EU special representative to the Middle East peace process, BelgiumChris Patten Former vice-president of the European commission, United KingdomHans-Gert Pöttering Former president of the European parliament, GermanyJacques Poos Former foreign minister, LuxembourgVesna Pusić Former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, CroatiaMary Robinson Former president and United Nations high commissioner for human rights, IrelandJacques Santer Former prime minister and president of the European commission, LuxembourgKarel Schwarzenberg Former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Czech RepublicRobert Serry Former UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, the NetherlandsJavier Solana Former foreign minister, Nato secretary general and EU high representative for common foreign and security policy, SpainMichael Spindelegger Former foreign minister and vice-chancellor, AustriaJack Straw Former foreign secretary, United KingdomGareth Thomas Former minister of state for international development, United KingdomErkki Tuomioja Former foreign minister, FinlandIvo Vajgl Former foreign minister, SloveniaJozias van Aartsen Former foreign minister, the NetherlandsFrank Vandenbroucke Former foreign minister, BelgiumHubert Védrine Former foreign minister, FranceSayeeda Warsi Former cabinet minister and Foreign Office minister for the United Nations, human rights and the ICC, United Kingdom
