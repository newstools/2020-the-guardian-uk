Perfect Sunday? If I’m home in LA, I’m up early for a hike in the mountains with my regular hike crew of close friends. After, we’ll do a little cardio workout and then go to the mall to look at tech. Then the spa: a freakin’ hot sauna, a vitamin flush, pedicure or manicure, a facial and a massage. My favourite Sunday smell is the eucalyptus massage oil. Sundays are for rebooting; the diary is clear and there are no obligations. Breakfast in or out? Always at my office, even on weekends. I don’t cook. I’ve been vegan for three years and I have a vegan chef who I share with my uncle. I’m livin’ the life! I’ll have oatmeal or vegan scrambled eggs and vegan ‘bacon’. If I’ve been good during the week, I’ll have pancakes. Favourite spot? A fantastic bookstore in Little Tokyo, LA. They specialise in Japanese books, but they also have all these trinkets and gadgets made with pristine detail – like a toothbrush, but the packaging is more awesome than the toothbrush. Shopping? Maxfield or H Lorenzo in LA for clothes. When I’m in London for The Voice it’s a coin toss between Harrods and Selfridges for shoes. Do you work? I must work every day, even if I have nothing to do. I might play around in my recording studio for a bit and follow up on some emails. But I’ll turn my phone off. Catch up on telly? I binge. I finished The Boys (Amazon Prime) in an afternoon, then I went straight through Messiah on Netflix– that was freakin’ great. What were Sundays like growing up? My favourite memory is going to my grandma’s house to hang out after she came back from church. She just had to be best friends with Jesus the amount of time she spent at church. The Voice UK is on ITV on Saturdays at 8.30pm
