An early start? I’m based in London, but spend weekends downin Hove when possible. On the coast I wake up naturally around 9am and look out to the sea. Playing music as I dress slowly is my Sunday luxury. That might be Bonnie Prince Billy or Nirvana. A morning routine? Breakfast is two boiled eggs, washed down with waterinfused with cucumber or lemon. Mum turned 90 this year – if she can’t sleep she’ll call around 11.30am. It’ll be the middle of the night in Tucson, Arizona, where she lives. It’s convenient she can call England if she can’t sleep. The perfect day out? In good weather I’ll head out for a walk along the seafront promenade; there’s nothing more relaxing than fresh air as you look out across the Channel towards the horizon. Then lunch – the Regency Restaurant, please. Fresh fish and seafood in a perfect period setting. Do you work? Rarely, although my gallery in Hove – Morena di Luna – is open weekends from March through October, so I’ll often show visitors around. I try to take people to the Pavilion, the treasure of the city. The music room is not to be missed. I love to show off Brighton and Hove, a progressive place full of creativity and imagination. A trip to the shops? At Infinity Foods I’ll pick up bits for the week ahead, before popping into Snoopers Paradise to get lost among the curiosities and vintage gems. Across the street is Resident Music – I love to listen to the albums they present so carefully, discovering tracks to bring back to London. Do you entertain? I’m much better at one-to-one time than with groups. Sunday night dinner at my apartment happens in stages: mains at the table, desert on the sofa, and a night-cap looking out to the ocean sunset. Then I curl up with a book in bed, not too late. At the moment I’m rereading The Little Prince by Antoine De Saint-Exupéry. maureenpaley.com
