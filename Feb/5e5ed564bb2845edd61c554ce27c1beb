After reading a Guardian article about the new digital railcard, I purchased a Network Railcard from railcard.co.uk a month ago. My payment was debited immediately, but the railcard wouldn’t load in the app. I have been battling ever since to get it working. It takes up to a week for Railcard to respond to each message, and each time the response simply consists of a new download code that doesn’t work. I was sent an email to use as proof of purchase, but advised that it may not be accepted and that if I have to pay extra for a ticket, it’s my responsibility to get a refund. KF, Oxford The problem, which has provoked similar frustration on Trustpilot, where 93% of the ratings are “bad”, is blamed on a systems upgrade designed to “enable a much quicker, smoother buying process”. The new improved platform, launched in November, has prevented hundreds of passengers from buying and accessing railcards and, despite promises to resolve the issue by New Year, Railcard’s website and Twitter still warn of problems. The Rail Delivery Group, which manages railcards, told the Observer that 99% of customers were receiving good service, but that it was taking longer than expected to contact and assist everyone affected. Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer, says: “We are extremely sorry for the problems and while we work urgently to resolve the issue, customers can still purchase most railcards in person from any National Rail ticket office or online via train operators Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway. We will also ensure that customers are not left out of pocket.” You have since been told your digital purchase can’t be fixed and have received a refund. You’re now going back to the old-fashioned card. If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
