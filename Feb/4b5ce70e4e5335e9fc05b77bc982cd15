Manchester United have made a proposal to install rail seating for up to 1,500 supporters at Old Trafford. They argue it would enhance fan safety in a part of the stadium where supporters persistently stand. The club conducted a feasibility study following changes to the Sports Ground Stadium Authority Green Guide. Minutes from the United fans’ forum on 31 January read: “A formal proposal was made to the local Safety Advisory Group in December 2019 to request a trial in a small section of the stadium (up to 1,500 seats in the north-east quadrant). “Our belief is that the introduction of rail seating will enhance spectator safety in areas of the stadium where – as with other clubs – we have seen examples of persistent standing. “The SAG committee is reviewing the request. This is not an automatic approval process. We will discuss the proposal in detail with the relevant authorities and will work through their compliance and review processes.” Meanwhile, United’s deadline-day signing Odion Ighalo will go straight into the squad for Monday’s game at Chelsea, despite missing the club’s warm-weather training camp. The 30-year-old has joined from Shanghai Shenhua but did not head to Spain with Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad because of the coronavirus outbreak. Solskjær said the club had left Ighalo in the UK because they were unsure whether he would be allowed to return to the country, having arrived from China in the previous fortnight. “He is going to travel with us,” the manager told club media of the game at Chelsea. “We will just see his fitness work this week and I think we will get him sharp. We want to integrate him as quickly as we can because, of course, he is desperate to play for us.”
