America a tough place to be pregnant and give birth, whether it be ungenerous family leave policies, the price of a stay in the delivery room or the cost of childcare. In her essay for the Guardian, Charlotte Sullivan writes of how she discovered that motherhood in the US was “not really a right but a privilege”. Her employer did not provide paid parental leave, and because of her precarious financial situation, she made the difficult decision to have an abortion.
