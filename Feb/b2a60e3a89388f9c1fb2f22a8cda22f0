There are times when I need a quick fix of baked goodness; a bite of crisp, chewy comfort to soothe a long day at work. When spending more time on my feet in the kitchen isn’t an option, freezer cookies are the perfect solution. A modest amount of preparation is done ahead of time, on a day when you’re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, then all that’s required is a few minutes in the oven before you’re enjoying the healing power of a freshly baked cookie – maybe with a scoop of ice-cream. Prep 20 minCook 15 minMakes 15 100g white caster sugar100g light brown muscovado sugar160g unsalted butter1 medium egg40g golden syrup200g plain flour1/2 tsp baking powder For the caramel chocolate cookies100g mini fudge pieces150g milk chocolate, roughly chopped For the oat, ginger and orange cookies1 orange, zest only80g porridge oats50g crystallised ginger Start by beating the sugars and butter until creamy. Tip in the egg, syrup, flour and baking powder, and stir to form a dough, then work in either the fudge and chocolate, or the orange zest, oats and ginger, until evenly dispersed. Form the dough into a log and lay it on a large rectangle of greaseproof paper. Roll up the paper around the dough and twist the ends to seal. Put in a zip-seal bag and store in the freezer. When you’re ready to bake, remove the log from the freezer and, when soft enough to slice, use a bread knife to slice off discs roughly 1cm thick. Lay on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and bake at 190C (180C fan)/gas 6 for 12 minutes, until golden-brown around the edges.
