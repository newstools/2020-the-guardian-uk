Activists have taken a Trojan horse into the grounds of the British Museum to protest against its sponsorship deal with the oil corporation BP. Protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors snuck their 13ft-tall wooden horse through a side gate at 7.30am on Friday and pulled it on to the forecourt in front of the museum’s entrance. The installation – based on the wooden horse in the ancient Greek myth of the siege of Troy – was timed to coincide with the museum’s latest exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as “supported by BP”. “The Troy exhibition has inspired us to create this magnificent beast, because the Trojan horse is the perfect metaphor for BP sponsorship,” said Helen Glynn, an activist with the theatrical protest group BP or not BP?. “On its surface the sponsorship looks like a generous gift, but inside lurks death and destruction.” The activists have asked the museum to allow them to keep the wooden horse outside the front door until Saturday, when a bigger demonstration is planned.

The protest is the latest move in activists’ campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship of the UK’s leading cultural institutions. In October, the Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public.
