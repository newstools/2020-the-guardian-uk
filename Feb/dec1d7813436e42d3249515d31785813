Debt in the UK is at a record high. Household debt has soared by a third in the last decade and there are an increasing number of people complaining that they have no disposable income at the start of the month after their financial obligations are taken from their salary. Meanwhile, it has never been easier to get credit - waiting in line at a high street store is enough time to be approved for a short term loan. We are interested in finding out how you have been affected by debt. How many credit cards and store cards do you own? Can you keep track of them? How easy is it to keep up monthly repayments, such as a car? If you’re a young person, do you think you will be able to afford a house?
