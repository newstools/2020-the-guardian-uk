Train travel offers some of the best adventures – a chance to get off-the-beaten track, to meet locals and soak up the scenery passing by. Whether it was on a steam train across tea plantations or the plains of Asia, a winding mountain railway, or a ramshackle local train to a memorable destination, we want to hear about your favourite rail journey. If you have a photo from the trip, do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe.
