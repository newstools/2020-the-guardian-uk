The craziest thing is I’m not even surprised anymore. Disgusting,” Sessegnon wrote on Instagram. Hoffenheim and Spurs offered their support to the 20-year-old winger.

We are driven by inclusion and equality for all and nobody should have to endure such repulsive abuse.” Everyone at the Club is with you @RyanSessegnon.
