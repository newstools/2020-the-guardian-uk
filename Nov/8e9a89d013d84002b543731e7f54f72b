Sheffield Wednesday have announced the appointment of Tony Pulis as their new manager. The 62-year-old succeeds Garry Monk, who was sacked by the club earlier this week. Pulis returns to management after leaving Middlesbrough in May 2019 and having previously managed Gillingham, Stoke, Crystal Palace and West Brom, among others. The job at Hillsborough is Pulis’s 11th in management and he takes charge of a club that sit second-bottom in the Championship, having been hit with a 12-point deduction in July, with the sanction reduced to six points last week following an appeal.
