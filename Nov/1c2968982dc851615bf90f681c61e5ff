A Michigan couple famous for having 14 sons have welcomed their first daughter, nearly three decades after the birth of their first child. Kateri Schwandt gave birth on Thursday to Maggie Jayne, who weighed in at 7lb 8oz and entered a world filled with 14 older brothers. Jay Schwandt said he and his wife, both 45, “are overjoyed and beyond excited to add Maggie Jayne to our family”. “This year has been memorable in so many ways, for so many reasons, but Maggie is the greatest gift we could ever imagine,“ he told the Detroit Free Press following his daughter’s birth at Mercy Health Saint Mary’s hospital in Grand Rapids. The Schwandts have been featured for years in local and national news. The couple have a live-streaming program called 14 Outdoorsmen that may now need a name change. Their oldest child, Tyler Schwandt, 28, said his parents thought they would never have a daughter at their home in the rural community of Lakeview, about 30 miles north-east of Grand Rapids. “I don’t even know if my mom owns any pink clothing – or anything,” said Tyler, who is engaged to be married and recently bought a home 20 minutes away from his parents’ 200-acre farm. The Schwandts started dating as high school freshmen. They wed in 1993, before they attended Ferris State University. Before they graduated, the couple had three sons. Both earned advanced degrees, even as their family grew. Kateri holds a master’s degree in social work from Grand Valley State University and Jay, a lawyer and owner of a land surveying business, holds a law degree from Western Michigan University’s Thomas M Cooley Law School.
