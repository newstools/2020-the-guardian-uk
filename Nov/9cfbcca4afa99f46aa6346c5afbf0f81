England Women powered to a 33-10 win over France after a dominant second-half performance. Amy Cokayne, Jess Breach and Alex Matthews scored in Grenoble while Emily Scarratt kicked 18 points. Cokayne powered over after seven minutes as England raced into a 7-0 lead before Gaëlle Hermet’s converted try levelled. Caroline Drouin’s penalty edged France ahead but Scarratt’s own penalty ensured it was 10-10 at half-time. England quickly took control after the break as Matthews went over three minutes from the restart after excellent work from Helena Rowland. Breach added England’s third two minutes later, with Scarratt converting again. Two more Scarratt penalties completed the win as grand slam champions England sealed a second victory over France this year following their 19-13 Six Nations win in February.
