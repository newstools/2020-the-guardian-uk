Primoz Roglic reclaimed the Vuelta a España overall lead when he won the 13th stage, a 33.7km time-trial ending with a sharp climb up to the Mirador de Ézaro at an average gradient of 14.8%. The Slovenian looked nothing like the rider who lost the Tour de France yellow jersey on the final time-trial, crushing the pedals in the last ascent to clock 46 minutes, 39 seconds and beat Will Barta by just one second. Richard Carapaz (Ineos-Grenadiers), who started the day in the red jersey, limited the damage to finish seventh, 49 seconds off the pace. He dropped to second overall, 39 seconds behind defending champion Roglic of Jumbo-Visma. Britain’s Hugh Carthy, who surged into contention with an impressive win on the Angliru in the 12th stage on Sunday, was on-par with Roglic in the first part of the solo effort against the clock but the EF Education First rider conceded 25 seconds up to the line. Carthy remains third overall, 47 seconds adrift. “It’s beautiful, eh?” Roglic told Eurosport. “It’s a long time since I won a time-trial. I felt strong, surprisingly. I thought I would suffer a lot more.” Wednesday’s 14th stage is the first of three hilly rides before the top contenders go all in on the 17th stage, which finishes at top of the Alto de la Covatilla on Saturday. Earlier, race organisers announced that all riders and other members of the ‘race bubble’ were tested for coronavirus, for a fourth time, on their rest day. All 681 tests came back negative.
