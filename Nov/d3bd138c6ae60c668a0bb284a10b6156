Donald Trump has made the claim that Sean Connery assisted him in getting planning applications passed in Scotland. It was announced on Saturday the James Bond actor had died aged 90. In a series of tweets, two days prior to the US election, Trump paid tribute to Connery, saying he was “highly regarded and respected in Scotland and beyond”. But his claim that Connery stepped in and shouted “let him build the damn thing” in connection with a big development is likely to raise eyebrows in Scotland. ....all I needed, everything went swimmingly from there. He was so highly regarded & respected in Scotland and beyond that years of future turmoil was avoided. Sean was a great actor and an even greater man. Sincere condolences to his family! He tweeted that “everything went swimmingly” with his development plans after initially “having a very hard time getting approvals”. The pair did know each other. Connery and Trump were photographed together at several events in New York, including the Johnnie Walker Dressed to Kilt fashion show in the early 2000s.
