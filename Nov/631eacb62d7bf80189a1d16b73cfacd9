I was puzzled by Mark Lawson’s article (Des O’Connor: TV’s singing, self-deprecating, enduring Mr Nice Guy, 15 November). Lawson describes Eric Morecambe’s jokes at Des O’Connor’s expense as “cruel”, alleging that “showbiz snobbery may have been involved”. I may have been too young in the 60s and 70s to pick up on the nuances of the alleged cruelty, but if Morecambe really was so vindictive, why would O’Connor have chosen to participate in so many Morecambe and Wise shows? According to Stuart Jeffries’ obituary (15 November), O’Connor used to send jokes at his own expense to Morecambe and Wise for use on their shows, and was happy to be the butt of their “affectionate teasing”.
