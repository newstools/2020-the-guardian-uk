Under the rules of England’s second lockdown, the majority of marriage and civil partnership ceremonies are prohibited. The only weddings allowed to take place are those where one of the couple is seriously ill. After its 17-day ‘firebreak’ lockdown, weddings in Wales can now go ahead, but the number of ceremony attendees depends on the venue capacity, and receptions are limited to 15 people. Up to 25 people can attend a wedding ceremony in Northern Ireland, but receptions are banned. In Scotland, where regions of the country are either in level 1, 2 or 3, no more than 20 people can attend a marriage ceremony or civil partnership. If you’re planning on going ahead with a wedding in the next few weeks or you’ve had to postpone one , we’d like to hear from you. How do you feel about putting your plans on hold? When do you hope to get married now? Have you made any alternate arrangements? Will you get married as soon as you can, or wait until more people can attend?
