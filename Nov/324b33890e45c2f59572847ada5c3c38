Voter turnout has been a key strategy for Democrats this election season. For the presidential race, the strategy worked. The US experienced a historic turnout rate of 65.1% – the highest in over 100 years – delivering the popular vote and electoral college to Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate. Over half of states saw an increase in voter turnout since 2016, with key battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania seeing participation well above the national rate. Though the pandemic introduced a number of complications to voting day, early voting and mail-in ballots brought a record turnout for some states. This was further complicated by the fact that some Republicans have further restricted access to voting, and voting protections in several states are weaker than ever. Many communities continued to experience difficulties this year in the form of long voting lines and sparse polling locations.
