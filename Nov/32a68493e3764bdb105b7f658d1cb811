With Diwali set to light up Indian communities around the world from 14 November, we’d like you tell us about festivals of light you’ve experienced. It could be a holy event, such as Hanukkah; a beautiful Asian lantern festival; a dazzling showstopper like the Fête des Lumières in Lyon; something more raucous, like Las Fallas in Valencia; or even a torchlit bonfire parade or carnival. If you have taken a great photograph of the festival, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words.
