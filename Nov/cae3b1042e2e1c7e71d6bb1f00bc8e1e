Your obituary (31 October) states that Sean Connery set up the Scottish International Education Trust to help “deprived children”. I received a grant when I was 22. I was going to Yale on a scholarship, which probably did not signal deprivation, as the grant was small. But the encouragement from Connery meant far more than the money. Years later I practically bumped into him in New York. Crossing the street, I heard him before I saw him. “Get outta the way ye schmuck,” he yelled at a cyclist who cut him up. The words were American, but constant with his acting career, the delivery was pure Fountainbridge.Moyna FlanniganEdinburgh • Regarding the reduction of 1,500 head office roles at John Lewis, it’s stated that “as a percentage, it’s almost a third” (Business view, 4 November).
