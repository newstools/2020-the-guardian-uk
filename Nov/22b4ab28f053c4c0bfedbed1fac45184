Barcelona put their domestic struggles to one side with a 4-0 victory over Dynamo Kyiv that sealed their progress through to the Champions League knockout stages. Ronald Koeman’s side suffered another La Liga loss at the weekend, this time to Atlético Madrid, but they have been perfect in Europe so far with four wins from four. It was goalless at half-time in Ukraine but Sergiño Dest scored his first for the club in the 52nd minute and Martin Braithwaite doubled the lead five minutes later before converting a penalty. The substitute Antoine Griezmann added a late fourth. Barça are three points ahead of Juventus in Group G, who left it late to clinch a 2-1 victory over Ferencvaros and are also into the last 16. Myrto Uzuni gave the Hungarian side a shock 19th-minute lead in Turin but Cristiano Ronaldo equalised 10 minutes before the break and Álvaro Morata struck the winner in stoppage time. Erling Haaland was on the scoresheet yet again for Borussia Dortmund, this time with a double in a 3-0 victory over Club Brugge. The Norwegian’s goals sandwiched a fine free-kick from Jadon Sancho. Dortmund lead Group F by one point from Lazio, who were 3-1 winners over Zenit St Petersburg in Rome. Ciro Immobile fired into the top corner in the third minute and Marco Parolo got his first Champions League goal with another spectacular strike in the 22nd minute. Artem Dzyuba pulled one back for Zenit before Immobile made sure of the points with a second-half penalty. In Group H, while Manchester United were comfortable winners over Istanbul Basaksehir, Paris Saint-Germain secured a much-needed 1-0 victory over RB Leipzig with Neymar’s 11th-minute penalty the only goal.
