A mother and a teenage daughter, not quite estranged but locked into diverging paths, are forced to find common ground when the daughterâ€™s degenerative disease deteriorates and it becomes clear that her life is about to end before her story has properly started. Rigorously unsentimental, this impressive Israeli feature debut from Ruthy Pribar stars a mesmerising Shira Haas (recently seen in Unorthodox) as Vika, the daughter struggling to resolve her frail, failing body with the urge to be a normal, rebellious teenager. As her mother, Asia, Alena Yiv is superb, creating a flawed, flesh-and-blood character who is smart enough to know that doing the right thing by her daughter might place her at odds with society and perhaps even the law.
