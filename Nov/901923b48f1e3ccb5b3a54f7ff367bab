Former NRL player Sam Burgess had “wild eyes” when he “went off” during a heated argument with his ex-wife’s father in his New South Wales southern highlands home, a court has heard. Phoebe Burgess gave evidence at Moss Vale local court on Monday about an incident in October 2019 that she says happened in her absence at Mitchell Hooke’s home. “My father called me to let me know Sam had finally left ... it wasn’t the call I was expecting,” she said. “He was emotional and shaky, he wasn’t making a lot of sense, saying he’s OK, ‘he’s gone, he had wild eyes ... he just came at me’.” Former South Sydney captain Burgess, 31, has pleaded not guilty to stalking or intimidating with the intention to cause fear or physical harm, while an apprehended violence order has been taken out on behalf of Ms Burgess’s father by police. Shortly after returning to the Glenquarry home, Ms Burgess was told by another family member: “Pheeb, he just went off”. Ms Burgess said her father’s mouth was dry and he was visibly shaken. “Never seen my father quite like that before … he was wobbly on his feet ... kept saying: ‘It’s OK, it’s OK … he just went at me.’” CCTV footage was played before the court showing Burgess interacting and taking pictures with fans while drinking four beers before he was due to visit the southern highlands home. Burgess’s lawyer, Phillip Boulten SC, accused Ms Burgess of seeking legal advice before calling the police. Burgess retired in 2019 after a 270-game NRL and English Super League career. He stood down from roles as a commentator and South Sydney assistant coach in October. The hearing continues before magistrate Robert Rabbidge.
