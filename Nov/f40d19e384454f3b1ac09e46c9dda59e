Germany’s coach, Joachim Löw, is not in danger of losing his job after the team were thrashed 6-0 by Spain in their final Nations League group match on Tuesday, the national team director Oliver Bierhoff has said. Germany suffered their worst defeat in a competitive game as Spain ran riot and a shell-shocked Löw was at a loss to explain his side’s capitulation in Seville which prevented their qualification for the Nations League semi-finals. Germany have hit a rough patch this year, winning only three of their last eight matches, but Bierhoff said Löw would remain in charge at least until the Euros next year. Asked whether Loew would remain the coach until the Euros, Bierhoff told ARD TV: “Absolutely, yes. This game changes nothing. We still trust Joachim Löw, no doubt about that. “With the national team, you have to think and analyse from tournament to tournament. We want to achieve the maximum at next year’s Euros.” Germany needed only a draw to progress to the Nations League semi-finals but the result ensured Spain advanced as the top-ranked team in the group.
