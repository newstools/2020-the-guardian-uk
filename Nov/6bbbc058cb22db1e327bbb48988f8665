The City of London, once the vibrant and bustling centre with hundreds of thousands of workers filling the streets of the Square Mile each day, has become been a place of ghosts in recent months. Two new films inspired by the City in lockdown explore our relationship with space during a socially distanced world of individual isolation. Each film features London Symphony Orchestra musicians, dancers and original compositions in collaboration with emerging film-makers to celebrate the creative energy of the City. Watch them exclusively here. Rising explores our longing for human connection alongside our relationship with space during a locked-down world. Directed by Antonia Luxem, it was filmed on the 34th floor of 100 Bishopsgate at twilight and features Marie Astrid Mence of Ballet Black with the LSO’s Maxine Kwok performing a new composition by Darren Bloom. The Spell & The Promise features Gareth Davies, LSO’s principal flute, performing a new composition by Jasmine Kent Rodgman, with dancers Faye Stoeser and Salomé Pressac and choreography by Harry Price, directed by Lexi Kiddo. It was filmed in London Wall Place, where ancient and modern architecture collide. The films were co-commissioned by Culture Mile – an initiative between the Corporation of London, LSO, Barbican, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Museum of London – and real-estate group Brookfield Properties. . The collaboration looks ahead to an outdoor music festival, Play, planned for May.
