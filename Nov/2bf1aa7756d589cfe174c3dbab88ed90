The Black Friday sale no longer lasts only a day – retailers have already started discounting in the run-up to 27 November. Here’s a roundup of some of the offers: • Aldi is running a Black Friday sale online and waiting until the day itself to launch its deal. It is offering a Nintendo Switch for £229 – £50 off the going rate. Other deals include a Lego Millennium Falcon kit for £59.99. • As the winter nights get longer, now may be the time to add a little security and peace of mind to your front door. With £60 off, the latest Ring Video Doorbell 3 could be the simple upgrade you’ve been looking for at only £119 from Amazon, Ring and other retailers. • If you’ve been considering upgrading to pay-TV, Sky’s 50% off deal may save you a fair chunk of change over 18 months. Plans start from £25 a month, plus a £20 one-off setup charge, with Sky Sports and Sky Cinema available at half price. • Very has a Samsung 55-inch TV reduced by £400 – £1,299 down to £899. The site currently says it is “awaiting stock” but it expects to deliver by 14 December – just in time for the Christmas specials. Also at Very, Apple’s AirPods Pro noise-cancelling headphones are reduced from £249 to £199. • Nespresso is selling a VertuoPlus coffee maker and Aeroccino 3 milk frother, plus 100 capsules, as a package for £89 until 2 December.
