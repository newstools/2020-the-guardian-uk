The RB Leipzig midfielder Tyler Adams says the United States are planning a show of support for racial justice when they return to action in Wales on Thursday for the first time since the killing of George Floyd. Minneapolis resident Floyd, a black man, died in May when a police officer pressed his knee against his neck for several minutes, an incident which sparked anti-racism protests across the US and the world. Several American players, including Adams, appeared in Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie’s “Enough is Enough” video in June and the USA team will now make an anti-racism stand before their friendly in Swansea on Thursday. “There have been internal discussions about that,” said Adams, who had “Black Lives Matter” written on his left boot and “Justice 4 George” on his right when he returned to Bundesliga action after Floyd’s death. “We’re kind of waiting until matchday to show how we can bring recognition to the situation. “We just want to continue to educate people about what’s going on and continuing to happen. There will be a little something on game day that we do. The internal discussions have been great within the team, supporting one another, sharing each other’s beliefs, and how people perceive certain situations and their opinions on it. Those open and difficult discussions have been really helpful to the team.” The American squad could take a knee at the Liberty Stadium as, following Floyd’s death, the US Soccer Federation withdrew the policy that required players to stand during the national anthem. It had been adopted in 2017 after Megan Rapinoe knelt in peaceful protest against police brutality and the oppression of black people in America, a move inspired by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
