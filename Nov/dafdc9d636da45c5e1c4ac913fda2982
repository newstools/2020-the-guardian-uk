The Dallas Cowboys canceled practice on Tuesday after what the club said was a medical emergency involving one of their strength and conditioning coaches. The Cowboys said Markus Paul “experienced a medical emergency” on Tuesday morning at the facility, where he was immediately treated by team medical personnel before being taken by ambulance to a hospital. “The organization extends its prayers and support to the Paul family, and asks for friends and followers of Markus, his family and the team to keep them in their thoughts and prayers,” the Cowboys said in a statement. An update from the team on Tuesday afternoon said that “per the Paul family, Markus is in the process of undergoing further medical tests.” It said additional information would be made available at the “appropriate time” and Paul’s condition was not related to Covid-19. Head coach Mike McCarthy’s daily meeting with reporters was canceled, as were interviews with players. Fifty-four-year-old Paul is a former NFL safety who played for the Chicago Bears (1989-93) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1993). He is in his third season with the Dallas Cowboys staff, after previously being a strength and conditional coach with the New Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, New York Jets and New York Giants. McCarthy told players at their scheduled 8am team meeting that practice had been canceled. That was about a half-hour after Paul’s medical emergency. Dallas are scheduled to play Washington on Thanksgiving. The Cowboys are coming off a win at Minnesota that gave them a chance to play for first place in the NFC East despite a 3-7 record. Washington also is 3-7.
