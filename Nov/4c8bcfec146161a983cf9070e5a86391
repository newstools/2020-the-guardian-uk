Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool face the “most difficult game in the world of football” at Manchester City on Sunday despite their title rival’s inconsistent start and the intense demands of a truncated season. The Premier League champions can move eight points clear of Pep Guardiola’s team with victory at the Etihad Stadium, albeit having played one game more, after responding to the loss of Virgil van Dijk with five straight wins in all competitions. City have yet to record back-to-back wins in the Premier League this term but Klopp, while dismissive of the suggestion Sunday’s game could have an impact on the title race, insists their threat and quality is undiminished. “It is important that we have our own plan and not only think about their plan, that we are brave, we play football with all we have and then we have a chance,” said the Liverpool manager. “But it is very difficult. This is the most difficult game in the world of football I would say, to play against Manchester City. “It is a very difficult game hopefully for both teams because both teams will perform on a high level. There are so many things that are different this season, nothing is to compare with last year. Nothing can compare with the year before. Everything is different and we just have to make sure we get through very intense periods, line up the fittest players, and play the best football we can.”
