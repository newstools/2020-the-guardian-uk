Diego Maradona, who was widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has died aged 60. The Argentinian footballing legend took his team to World Cup glory in 1986, and a quarter-final victory over England saw him score what has been described as the greatest goal of all time. Such was his impact at club Napoli, that they announced in 2000 that they were retiring his No 10 shirt. We would like to hear what Maradona meant to you.
