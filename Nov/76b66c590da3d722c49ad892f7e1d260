A Los Angeles woman has filed a restraining order against Diplo, AKA Thomas Wesley Pentz, seeking to prevent the producer from “distributing revenge porn” that she claims is “designed to humiliate her and to scare other women out of coming forward”, the Daily Beast reports. The woman claimed in a Twitter thread that Pentz groomed her and hired a private investigator to “scare me into not speaking out on the disgusting details I know about him”. She further alleged that Pentz had filmed the pair engaging in sexual activity without her permission. She tweeted: “I SPECIFICALLY asked him not too & his reply was ‘fuck it. I’m recording this’”. She called Pentz “a huge manipulating liar / gaslighter … who PREYS young women of ALL races (to be honest) but primarily young naive women of color”. Pentz’s lawyer, Bryan J Freedman, told Pitchfork: “Unfortunately, this individual has been harassing my client and his family for more than a year and has repeatedly refused to stop doing so. To be clear, in no way has my client violated any law. In fact, he has repeatedly made it clear that he wants nothing whatsoever to do with this person – and simply needs her ongoing harassment of his family to end.” The woman is represented by prominent lawyer Lisa Bloom, who has represented victims of Bill Cosby and alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein and defended Harvey Weinstein. She told the Daily Beast that the woman had undergone “an elaborate vetting process which she cleared. I find her to be very credible and to have corroborating evidence in support of her claims.”
