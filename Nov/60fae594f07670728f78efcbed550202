It was sad to see the way Frank Bough was brought low when aspects of his private life were exposed. He should, however, be remembered as a kind and decent man, as shown by his volunteering his services free of charge when the BBC launched its “public access” series, Open Door. Groups and individuals were enabled to make programmes in order to have “their own say in their own way”. Frank realised that some “accessees” might benefit from sympathetic, professional presentation skills. His offer gave support to a project that went on to provide a vital public service.
