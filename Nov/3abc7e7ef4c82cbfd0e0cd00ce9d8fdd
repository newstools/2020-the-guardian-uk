Scrape down the bowl, add the egg and beat again. Pour in the melted chocolate and mix. In a separate bowl, stir the remaining dry ingredients until evenly combined. Tip into the chocolate mixture and stir until no lumps remain. Scrape into a container and put in the fridge until the dough sets – two to four hours. Divide the dough into 50-55g balls and flatten slightly. Chop the white chocolate into 15g portions (it’s OK if this is in chunks). Put these into the middle of the dough balls and fold up the sides to cover the white chocolate. Put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper, leaving enough space in between each one for them to spread, and refrigerate overnight (or freeze). Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Bake for 14 minutes. Leave to cool on the tray, then remove and eate. If baking from frozen, defrost first or add one or two minutes extra to the bake time. This is a great no-chocolate cookie.
