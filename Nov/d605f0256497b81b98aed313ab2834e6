As academics in the field of education and social sciences, we are writing to express our concern about the recent pattern of statements and policy guidance by politicians proscribing certain materials and bodies of work from the curriculum in schools and colleges. This includes materials that support calls to abolish or overthrow capitalism, that critique white privilege, or that promote “divisive or victim narratives”. We are particularly concerned by the misrepresentation of critical race theory, a well-established, diverse body of work. At a time when racism is on the rise, in Britain and globally, teachers and pupils can benefit from the tools and resources developed by critical race theorists to understand how racism operates across society, including in education. To target this body of theory at this moment in time amounts to an attack on black scholars and activists who are already struggling against racial injustice. Dissent, diversity and critique are the lifeblood of democracy and of any educational experience that nurtures intellectual growth and creativity. Policymakers are in danger of stifling the climate of pluralism on which democracy depends. Recent guidance bans teachers from engaging with ideas that promote the disregard of English civil or criminal law, or that advocate anti-capitalist positions. Yet our history is one of struggles against prevailing orthodoxies by dissenting individuals and movements like the suffragettes, the Chartists, and the abolitionists, some of whom were willing to break the law in order to fight for the freedoms we enjoy today. At a time when democratic institutions and hard-won commitments to equalities are under threat from populist politicians, and when a human-made environmental crisis threatens communities and individuals, classrooms should be places of creative, critical thinking and engagement with ideas that can help society move towards more just and sustainable ways of living. The recent student climate marches and the Black Lives Matter protests have demonstrated that young people are only too aware of current injustices and willing to act collectively for change. As educators, we should be supporting and encouraging their critical capacities and political agency through informed engagement with a wide range of resources. Attempts to limit the range of ideas on offer undermine this core educational and democratic goal.
