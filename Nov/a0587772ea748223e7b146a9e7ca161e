Music moves us in many ways. This week we ran a feature by Nayantara Dutta on how listening to Mendelssohn’s Fingal’s Cave inspired her to visit the site off the Scottish coast. We would love to hear what pieces of music have inspired you to travel. Perhaps you journeyed to a landmark referenced in a song, or maybe a piece of music made you want to explore a different culture or take a road trip on the other side of the world. In lockdown, music might have been the inspiration for a walk. Wherever music has taken you, we’d love to hear about it and the travel it inspired. If you have a great photograph of you on your travels, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe.
