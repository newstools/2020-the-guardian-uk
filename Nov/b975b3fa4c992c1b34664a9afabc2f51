Your writer from Northampton complained that his team’s FA Cup tie with Oxford United was ignored (Letters, 11 November). Given that the Cobblers were in fact playing non-league Oxford City and lost 2-1, I should think he would be quite pleased at the Guardian’s silence on the matter.Steve CardenBrighton, West Sussex • Just before the consequences of Brexit hit, Dominic Cummings jumps ship (Dominic Cummings to leave Downing Street role by Christmas, 13 November). The rat.Pete BibbySheffield • Maybe Boris Johnson was actually telling the truth when he said that the virus would be gone by Christmas.Ian Grieve Gordon Bennett, Llangollen Canal • In the discussion of Maggi Hambling’s sculpture, Linda Fairbrother contrasts the representation of men and women (Letters, 11 November).

Simple, solid and effective.Jan MortimerLewes, East Sussex • I would like to reassure Linda Fairbrother that there is a recent statue of a suffragette that is truly excellent. Emily Wilding Davison has been commemorated in her home town of Morpeth with a statue made of steel. Emily is fully clothed and inspires us all whenever we pass her.Livia MacDonald Morpeth, Northumberland
