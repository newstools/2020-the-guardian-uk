Celtic set themselves up for an unprecedented fourth successive Scottish Cup win, reaching the final with a 2-0 win over Aberdeen at a sodden Hampden Park. The Parkhead side, also aiming for a fourth consecutive domestic treble, took the lead through Ryan Christie’s 18th minute goal, before Mohamed Elyounoussi added a second only five minutes later. The Dons had taken a point in a 3-3 Premiership draw between the teams at Pittodrie last Sunday, but found Neil Lennon’s side a different proposition in the almost constant rain. Celtic refused to allow Derek McInnes’s side a glimmer of hope and in the end ran out comfortable winners. The Parkhead side will play Hearts in the final, also at the national stadium, on 20 December a repeat of the 2019 final which Celtic won 2-1. Having now won 35 successive domestic cup ties the Hoops will be odds-on to extend that record against the Championship side and make more history. Meanwhile, James Tavernier’s 10th goal of the season sent Rangers nine points clear in the Premiership as they came through a trip to a ground which has proved a major stumbling block in recent years. The Rangers captain’s sixth converted penalty of the campaign earned a 1-0 victory over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. Rangers had only won once in their previous seven league games at the Ayrshire venue, losing on four of their last five league visits. Steven Gerrard’s side started well this time and were ahead in the 19th minute, and kept their 15th clean sheet of the season despite a spirited second-half showing from the home side. The result increased the pressure on Celtic, who now have two games in hand.
