Pope Francis lauded a delegation of NBA players who met him at the Vatican on Monday as “champions” and said he supported their work on addressing social injustice. Five players – Marco Belinelli, Sterling Brown, Jonathan Isaac, Kyle Korver and Anthony Tolliver – were joined by NBA players’ union executive director Michele Roberts and two other union executives, Sherrie Deans and Matteo Zuretti. #PopeFrancis met today with reps of the NBA Players Association to talk about their efforts to promote racial equality, social justice & to feed the poor.

The union said the players spoke about their “individual and collective efforts addressing social and economic injustice and inequality occurring in their communities.” Belinelli addressed the pope in Italian, and the group presented the pope with gifts including a commemorative basketball and an Orlando Magic jersey. “You’re champions,” Pope Francis said. “But also giving the example of teamwork, you’ve become a model, giving that good example of teamwork but always remaining humble ... and preserving your own humanity.” The audience was held days before a book comes out in which Pope Francis supports demands for racial justice, specifically the actions taken following the killing of George Floyd, a black man killed by US police in May. Roberts said Pope Francis sought the meeting with the players, and that it “demonstrates the influence of their platforms.” Demands for social and racial justice have been paramount among players, especially in recent months following the deaths of Floyd and Breonna Taylor, among others. Brown, in his remarks to the pope, told him about what he and the Milwaukee Bucks went through in the NBA’s restart bubble particularly when they decided to sit out a playoff game against Orlando in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. “It was raw and emotional for our team,” Brown told the pope. Brown sued officials in Milwaukee after tasered and arrested during an encounter with police in 2018, contending officers used excessive force and targeted him because he is black. A settlement awarded Brown $750,000 plus an admission from the city that his civil rights were violated. “We are extremely honored to have had this opportunity to come to the Vatican and share our experiences with Pope Francis,” Korver said. “His openness and eagerness to discuss these issues was inspiring and a reminder that our work has had a global impact and must continue moving forward.”
