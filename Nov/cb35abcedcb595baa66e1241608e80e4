Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain were left stunned by a second-half comeback from Monaco, who won 3-2 after ending the first half 2-0 down. Cesc Fàbregas was instrumental in the hosts’ fightback after being brought on at half time, setting up Kevin Volland’s equaliser and then converting a late penalty after Abdou Diallo fouled Kevin Volland. Thomas Tuchel’s side had looked in total control after Kylian Mbappé’s first-half double on his return from injury. The forward struck first in the 25th minute with a shot into the top corner, then added a penalty 12 minutes later from the penalty spot after Rafinha was brought down by Youssouf Fofana. PSG could have been further out of sight at Stade Louis II before the break, but Moise Kean was disallowed for offside by the VAR. Mbappé pounced on a defensive error to strike again just before half-time, but his goal was also chalked off. The Monaco head coach, Niko Kovac, brought on Fàbregas and Caio Henrique for the second half and saw his team immediately raise their level. Volland reduced the arrears in the 52nd minute with a shot from close range, and struck again 14 minutes later from Fàbregas’s cross. Tuchel brought on Neymar in an effort to turn the tide back in the visitors’ favour, but Diallo’s clumsy foul on Volland six minutes from time settled the game. The centre-back was sent off, and Fàbregas powered the ball past Keylor Navas to complete the comeback. Victory lifted Monaco up to second, four points behind PSG, who had won their last eight league games after starting the season with two defeats.
