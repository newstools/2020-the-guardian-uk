Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez will take on Liverpool’s Callum Smith on 19 December, it has been announced by promoter Matchroom. The pair will face off in the United States just before Christmas with the WBA and Ring magazine world super-middleweight titles on the line. Smith had set his sights on the Mexican, who is considered one of the finest fighters in boxing, back in June. The 30-year-old finally has his man and speaking about the upcoming bout, he said: “I’ve been wanting a big fight since becoming world champion, so I’m pleased that during these challenging times we can deliver to the fans a fight between the very best in the division. I truly believe I beat him and will prove that 168lbs is my division.” 🗣 @CallumSmith23 #CaneloSmith | December 19 on @DAZNBoxing pic.twitter.com/fejLcRBn3o Alvarez has held world belts in four weight divisions but recently became a free agent after parting with streaming service DAZN and Golden Boy Promotions. He has lost just once - to Floyd Mayweather in September 2013 - in 56 fights, while Smith is undefeated in 27 bouts and has defended his world title twice since winning it from George Groves in 2018.
