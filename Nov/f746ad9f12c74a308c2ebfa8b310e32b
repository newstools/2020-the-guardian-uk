As working from home continues inexorably, my cooking is morphing. I still cook feasts for special occasions, but for the everyday, I lean on recipes with few ingredients, minimal fuss and a flexible outcome. The recipe below takes little time to prepare and the results are delicious with a salad of braised greens, shredded into pasta, popped into a puff pastry pie or even bubble and squeak. Rich pickings. Prep this when you have 10 minutes free, and keep in the fridge ready to bake. The chicken fat oozes out into the potatoes and radicchio, creating a mouthwatering dish. Prep 10 minCook 1 hr 15 minServes 2-41 head radicchio, roughly shredded1 large red onion, peeled and thinly sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced80g thin slices pancetta, cut in half across the middle800g potatoes, sliced thinly (use a mandoline, if you have one)A few sprigs of rosemary, leaves picked4 chicken legs150ml double cream6 tbsp good olive oil Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put all the ingredients except the chicken, cream and a tablespoon of the oil into a large roasting dish, and season. Mix thoroughly with your hands and spread out evenly. Rub the chicken legs all over with the reserved oil, then season , pop on top of the potatoes and bake for an hour. Remove from the oven, pour over the cream and turn up the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Return the dish to the oven for a final 10-15 minutes, by which time the cream will be bubbling and the chicken golden. Serve immediately with a crisp, green salad. I hoard stock, particularly as it is said to be so good at fighting off bugs. When you buy the chicken for this, ask your butcher for extra wings and giblets to cook up with the bones after the dish is finished. Or use a whole jointed bird instead.
