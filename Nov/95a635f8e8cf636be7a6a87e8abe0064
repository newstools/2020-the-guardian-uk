Rishi Sunak’s “levelling-up fund” (Report, 25 November) of £4bn for England should be seen in perspective. It is the same amount that 4,000 London bankers paid themselves for a year’s “work” at the height of austerity.Mike WilsonWigton, Cumbria • Barbara Thompson, a vaccination trial volunteer, laments the lack of biscuits for participants (Letters, 25 November). Pah! In the 1960s, Guy’s hospital in London used to give blood donors a bottle of stout. A decade later, when my wife and I gave blood in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the going rate was a small loaf and a tin of herrings. Settle for nothing less, Barbara.Alex KirbyLewes, East Sussex • I enjoyed the Pass notes column on the demise of cricketers’ teas (25 November) until the penultimate line. “Scone, but not forgotten” doesn’t make sense in these parts.Richard ElliottTollerton, Nottingham • There is no need for the Guardian to print Christmas wrapping paper (Letters, 26 November): any page can become wrapping and it means I don’t have to use labels as everyone recognises a present from me.Dr Peter BakerPrestwood, Buckinghamshire • Regarding toilet roll shortages, when I were a lad, we had an outside toilet with a wooden seat and a nail for the torn-up newspaper (Letters, 26 November). My dad bought the Daily Express every weekday and I hated its awful content. I asked him why he bought it. His answer: “It’s the most absorbent.”John HackneyHyde, Greater Manchester
