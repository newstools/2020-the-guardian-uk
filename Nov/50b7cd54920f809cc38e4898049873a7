Historically, most spirit-based punches were made using either arrack or rum. Bajan (Barbadian) rum punch is one of the oldest and has a simple recipe enshrined in a national rhyme: “One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak.” That is, one part lime juice, two parts sweetener, three parts rum (preferably from Barbados) and four parts water. Our take on this classic uses tea instead of water, to add some extra depth of flavour. Makes 1 litre 200ml dark navy-strength rum – we use one developed for us by Manchester Distillery, but any high-quality navy-strength rum, such as Pusser’s Gunpowder Proof Black Label, will work100ml brandy – one with a good fruit quality: we use Baron de Sigognac 10 Year Old600ml English breakfast tea – brewed stronger than normal and left to cool150ml lemon juice300g demerara sugar Put everything into a large bowl, add lots of ice and stir well. Ladle into tumblers filled with fresh ice, garnish each glass with a slice of lemon or orange (we use dried orange slices), and serve. • Ben Robinson, head sommelier, Moor Hall Restaurant, Aughton, West Lancashire
