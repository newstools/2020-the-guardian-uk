Enjoying the local cuisine is one of travel’s greatest pleasures – through food, we can get a real taste of a destination. Do you have a particular dish or food memory that takes you right back to a special place and moment? Perhaps a traditional bouillabaisse in Provence, a tagine in Morocco or a local seafood dish on a tropical beach? Tell us what it was, where you tried it and the memories it conjures up. If you have a photo of the dish, do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher for a stay at a Sawday’s property – the company has more than 3,000 in the UK and Europe. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website, and maybe the paper too. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition.
