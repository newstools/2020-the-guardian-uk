The Republic of Ireland midfielder Alan Browne has tested positive for coronavirus following Thursday night’s 3-0 defeat by England. Browne, who played the full 90 minutes at Wembley, has been isolated from the rest of the group before Sunday’s Nations League fixture against Wales in Cardiff. A Football Association of Ireland statement said: “The Football Association of Ireland can confirm Ireland midfielder Alan Browne has tested positive for Covid-19. “The player has been isolated from the group as per protocols. Uefa have been informed of this development. There are no close contacts of the player and the rest of the staff and squad tested negative ahead of Sunday’s Nations League fixture against Wales in Cardiff.” Browne is the second Ireland player to give a positive result this week, with the West Bromwich Albion striker Callum Robinson having missed the England game for the same reason. Aaron Connolly and Adam Idah had to sit out last month’s Euro 2020 play-off semi-final in Slovakia as close contacts of a member of staff who later tested positive on the flight to Bratislava, while four more players were withdrawn on the squad’s return to Dublin. It is understood that England’s preparations for their Nations League fixtures against Belgium and Iceland will not be affected as the Return to Play protocol is designed to legislate for such occurrences.
