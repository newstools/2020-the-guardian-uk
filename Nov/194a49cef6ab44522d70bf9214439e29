England claimed their second successive grand slam after thumping Italy 54-0 in their Women’s Six Nations finale. The Red Roses were crowned champions last weekend when France were held to a 13-13 draw in Scotland, and they hammered Italy on Sunday evening to wrap up their 15th grand slam. England set the ball rolling in the fourth minute with a try from Ellie Kildunne, with Emily Scarratt duly converting to put the first points on the board. Poppy Cleall then broke through to double England’s advantage before Scarratt stepped up again to convert. After a Sarah Bern effort was chalked off by the referee, who deemed the ball had been passed forward in the line-out, Scarratt then surged forward to score a try of her own, with Abbie Ward increasing the scoreline to 28-0 before the break. Bern pushed forward again in the second half, finally getting on the scoreboard as Scarratt added a conversion to make it 35-0. Jess Breach, the tournament’s top try-scorer, struck after 69 minutes to compound Italy’s misery, though Scarratt’s replacement Zoe Harrison was unable to add the extra points. After Leanne Riley crossed in the 78th minute, England’s runaway victory was then topped by a final try from Marlie Packer in the dying moments of the game, with Harrison this time providing the conversion for both to wind up an emphatic 80 minutes for Simon Middleton’s squad.
