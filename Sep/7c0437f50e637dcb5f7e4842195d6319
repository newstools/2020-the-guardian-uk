The Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, visited him at the Berlin hospital where he was treated after being poisoned with novichok. “I am very grateful to Chancellor Merkel for visiting me at the hospital,” the anti-corruption campaigner tweeted on Monday, after reports of the meeting in German media. The Kremlin critic was discharged from Charité hospital in the German capital last week after receiving treatment over several weeks for exposure to the nerve agent. Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow in August in what his allies say was a state-sanctioned attack – labs in France, Germany and Sweden confirmed he had been poisoned. The German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Sunday that Merkel had visited him in what it described as a “secret” meeting at the hospital that underscored the chancellor’s personal commitment to the case. Navalny confirmed the meeting but argued the label “secret” was not accurate, saying: “Rather, a private meeting and conversation with the family.” The Kremlin has denied allegations of involvement in the poisoning and accused western leaders of launching a disinformation campaign over the opposition leader’s illness. Russia claims medical tests carried out by doctors in Omsk found no poison in Navalny’s body. It says the case lacks grounds for a criminal investigation, despite international calls for a transparent inquiry. Navalny’s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, has said the Kremlin critic plans to return to Russia but will remain in Germany until he has recovered.
