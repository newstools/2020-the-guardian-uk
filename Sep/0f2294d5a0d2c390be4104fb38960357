With summer drawing to a close, people across the country are looking back through their holiday photos feeling perhaps a little less rested than they had done in previous years. Mercurial changes in the governmentâ€™s travel corridor list have caused lots of holidaymakers to repatriate prematurely to UK shores in an effort to avoid quarantine restrictions. Many more chose not to leave the UK at all, and in July there was an 87% slump in demand for European flights compared with the same month last year.

A family pauses for a quick break as they hike through the hills surrounding Dovestone reservoir These photos show British holidaymakers who have abandoned their usual getaway plans on white-sand beaches and Mediterranean squares, and instead have reacquainted themselves with, or even discovered for the first time, the pastures green often taken for granted on their doorstep.
