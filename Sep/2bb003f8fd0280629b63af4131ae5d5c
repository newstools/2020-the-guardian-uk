Fantastic Beasts star Eddie Redmayne has said he is alarmed by the “vitriol” aimed at Harry Potter author JK Rowling after her comments on trans rights, adding the reaction on social media was “absolutely disgusting”. Redmayne was speaking to the Daily Mail during the shoot of the third Fantastic Beasts film, which is produced and co-written by Rowling. He said he had sent her a private note. Redmayne also defended his “trans friends and colleagues” who are “facing discrimination on a daily basis”, adding: “Similarly, there continues to be a hideous torrent of abuse towards trans people online and out in the world that is devastating.” In June, Redmayne publicly disagreed with Rowling’s lengthy statement on trans rights. He said: “As someone who has worked with both JK Rowling and members of the trans community, I wanted to make it absolutely clear where I stand. I disagree with Jo’s comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and nonbinary identities are valid.” Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson also stated their disagreement.
