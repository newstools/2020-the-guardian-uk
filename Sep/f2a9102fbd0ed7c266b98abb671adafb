Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix. Under the new partnership, the couple will produce documentaries, feature films and scripted shows for the streaming platform, further details of which are yet to emerge. “Our lives, both independent of each other, and as a couple have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit: of courage, resilience and the need for connection,” Meghan and Harry said in a joint statement. “Through our work with diverse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope. As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us, as is powerful storytelling through a truthful and relatable lens.” The news arrives after the couple had been reportedly meeting with different Hollywood studios after moving to California earlier this year. Markle’s return to show business in April saw her narrate Elephant, a nature documentary for Disney. “Harry and Meghan have inspired millions of people all around the world with their authenticity, optimism and leadership,” said Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO and chief content officer of Netflix. “We’re incredibly proud they have chosen Netflix as their creative home – and are excited about telling stories with them that can help build resilience and increase understanding for audiences everywhere.” The deal is similar to the one that Barack and Michelle Obama inked in 2018. The former first couple went on to acquire the Sundance hit American Factory, which won the Oscar for best documentary. Becoming, a documentary focused on Michelle Obama, was also released earlier this year. Netflix has also secured big money long-term partnerships with the Grey’s Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes and American Horror Story’s Ryan Murphy in recent years.
