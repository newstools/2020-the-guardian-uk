Sussex have confirmed that the veteran bowler Mitch Claydon is suspended following an allegation of placing hand sanitiser on the ball during the Bob Willis Trophy match against Middlesex last month. The 37-year-old Australian took three first-innings wickets in the fixture at Radlett, Hertfordshire, which Middlesex won by five wickets. The England and Wales Cricket Board is investigating. Sussex posted an update on their website regarding their next Bob Willis Trophy match, against Surrey, which updated the availability of David Wiese following his return from South Africa. Claydon, though, will not be part of the 14-man squad as the governing body carries out an investigation. Sussex’s statement said: “Mitch Claydon is suspended pending the outcome of an ECB allegation of placing hand sanitiser on the ball in our match against Middlesex. There will be no further comment at this stage.”
