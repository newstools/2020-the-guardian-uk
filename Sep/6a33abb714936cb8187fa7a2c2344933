Recently crowned US Open champion Naomi Osaka has withdrawn from the French Open in another serious blow to organisers of the tournament in Paris. Osaka, who claimed her third grand slam title in New York last week, is struggling with a hamstring injury and joins world No 1 Ash Barty in pulling out of competition at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old wore tape on her left hamstring as she came from a set down to beat Victoria Azarenka in the final at Flushing Meadows at the weekend, and said the turnaround between tournaments was too tight for her to recover fully. “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to play the French Open this year,” the world No 3 wrote on social media. “My hamstring is still sore so I won’t have time to prepare for the clay – these two tournaments came too close to each other for me this time. I wish the organisers and players all the best.” Reigning French Open champion Barty pulled out earlier this month, citing concerns over coronavirus and a lack of training time spent with her coach. The French Open is scheduled to go ahead, starting on 27 September, despite high numbers of Covid-19 cases reported in the country. The pandemic had already forced the event to be delayed from its original slot in the tennis calendar in May and June.
