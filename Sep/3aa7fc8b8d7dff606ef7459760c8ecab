Premier Inn owner Whitbread is to cut up to 6,000 jobs across its hotels and restaurants, almost one in five of its workforce. Pubs group JD Wetherspoon also announced plans to cut up to 450 jobs at its pubs at six airports – Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow – due to lack of trade. Whitbread said the bulk of the cuts – 4,500 – will come at its Premier Inn budget hotel chain, while another 1,500 jobs will go at its Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains from November. Most of them will be voluntary redundancies. Alison Brittain, the Whitbread chief executive, said the government’s job retention scheme had been a great help, but it expires at the end of October which will be “a significant moment”. About 20,000 of the group’s 35,000-strong workforce are currently on flexible furlough, which means they are working some of the time. Whitbread has been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, which forced it to shut its UK hotels and restaurants for four months from late March. Like-for-like sales collapsed by 77.6% in the first half. The moves comes as pubs, bars and restaurants in England face new restrictions amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus this autumn. Premises will have to shut at 10pm from Thursday. Whitbread’s pub restaurants do not tend to get much trade after that hour, but “all restrictions cause people more anxiety, more nervousness and more caution” and will prompt some of them to “think more carefully about whether they are going to go out,” Brittain said. The company has also been affected by local lockdowns.

Laura Ashley – 2,700 jobs17 March: Laura Ashley collapsed into administration, with 2,700 job losses, and said rescue talks had been thwarted by the pandemic. The pandemic has led to thousands of job losses in the hospitality sector. Whitbread’s former chain Costa Coffee, which was sold to Coca-Cola two years ago, is cutting up to 1,650 jobs in its cafes, more than one in 10 of its workforce. Pizza Express is closing 73 restaurants as part of a rescue restructure deal with the loss of 1,100 staff, and the sandwich chain Pret a Manger is cutting nearly 2,900 jobs. The vast majority of Premier Inn hotels and pub restaurants reopened in the first week of August, and 801 hotels were open by the end of the month. Whitbread said demand was strong in seaside towns and traditional regional tourist hotspots such as Bath, where almost 80% of its hotel rooms were full in August. Premier Inn’s seaside locations include Brighton, Blackpool and Newquay. However, it was quiet elsewhere, particularly in London and other large cities. In the capital, it filled only 30% of rooms. In August, hotels and restaurants received a boost from staycations and the eat out to help out scheme, but hotel sales were still down 47.3% year on year, while total UK sales including restaurants were 38.5% below last year. Business bookings usually pick up in September and October after a quiet summer but this is unlikely to happen this year. Brittain said tradespeople such as plumbers and electricians who need to travel for their work are still staying at Premier Inn, while office workers, many of whom are now working from home, have stayed away. Brittain said: “The sector is at the vanguard of everything negative about the pandemic, from complete closure of all businesses for a significant period to opening in a very constrained way with social distancing measures. We are going to have a longer period of this suppressed demand.” She said hospitality firms would find it hard to survive through “multiple U-shapes where we’ll have opening the economy, then closing it down a little bit and reopening a bit in a continuous way until a vaccine arrives”. She said a permanent VAT reduction for the sector and an extension of the business rates holiday for another year would be “enormously helpful” – as would an extension of the furlough scheme. Whitbread has already cut 150 jobs at its head office. The JD Wetherspoon chief executive, John Hutson, said the decision to cut jobs “mainly a result of a downturn in trade in these pubs, linked with the large reduction in passenger numbers using the airports”. He said no firm decisions had been made and that the group would listen to suggestions from staff to help avoid or reduce the number of compulsory redundancies.
