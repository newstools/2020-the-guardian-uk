Gary Lineker’s pay cut (Gary Lineker agrees £400,000 BBC pay cut and to tweet more carefully, 15 September) is roughly the equivalent of the entire annual average wages of 40 Tesco checkout workers. His original salary equated to the annual wages of 175 similar workers. Can you imagine the consequent resentment at these payments in the hearts of the low-paid, struggling to even exist, leading to animosity against the BBC and a reluctance to pay the licence fee? Shame on the BBC for paying such amounts to people of dubious talents. It should be an honour to work for the BBC at a reasonable salary, not a way of becoming a millionaire.Susan Castles Wem, Shropshire • How can the BBC justify asking pensioners over 75 to pay for their TV licences, when salaries of more than £1m are being paid to Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball?Marian SpathakyOadby, Leicester • Why does Gary Lineker earn more money than Boris Johnson?
