While Chadwick Boseman was a theatre student at Howard University, Washington, he applied to join the course that the British American Drama Academy puts on each summer in Oxford. The actor Phylicia Rashad persuaded several friends, including Denzel Washington, to anonymously fund him and nine other of her students. Ian Wooldridge, then dean of BADA, found Chadwick to be “diligent, enthusiastic, with great wit; generous and a joy to work with in the room”. And many of the students that have followed him have told our present dean, Eunice Roberts, that they were auditioning to train at BADA so as to follow in his footsteps. He was an inspiration to all actors and will continue to be, not least for all our students.
