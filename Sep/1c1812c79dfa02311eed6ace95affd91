Manchester United have confirmed the signing of the midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax. The Netherlands international is understood to have cost an initial €39m (£34.7m), with a possible €5m to follow in add-ons. United faced competition from clubs including Real Madrid for the 23-year-old, who scored 41 goals in 175 appearances for Ajax after coming through their academy. Van de Beek, who has played 10 times for the Netherlands, is United’s first signing of the summer. He is in line to link up with Bruno Fernandes in central midfield as Ole Gunnar Solskjær tries to build a team capable of challenging for the Premier League title. Van de Beek has a five-year contract with the option of a further season and told United’s website: “I cannot begin to explain how incredible an opportunity it is to join a club with such an amazing history. I would like to thank everyone at Ajax, I grew up there and I will always have a special bond with the club. “I am now ready to take the next step in my career and perform at the highest level and there is no higher standard than Manchester United.”
