Michael Green did things without you noticing. In 1997, as MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, I said to him that none of my schools on the Isle of Sheppey could afford more than £1 for a school visit, but this £1 would not take them off the island. This meant they could never go to parliament, to Buckingham Palace, to the V&A, the Science Museum or the British Museum, and much else besides. Michael was head honcho (PR) at Vivendi, which owned Connex, our rail operator. I asked gently if they could provide a £1 fare to London outside rush hour for my schoolchildren. He could and did. Our schools made dozens and dozens of trips to London thanks to his “word in the right ear”.
