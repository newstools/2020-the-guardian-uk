This is a great, seasonal and easy drink to make at home. You’ll need to prepare the pickled ginger juice three or four days in advance, though, to give it time to do its thing. These quantities make enough cordial and pickled ginger juice for four or five servings, so store any excess in clean jars in the fridge. The ginger juice keeps for ages, and is a great addition to fresh lemonade and mocktails, too. Serves 1 For the camomile cordial50ml water 1 bag camomile tea50g sugar For the pickled ginger juice75g fresh root ginger50ml water 50g sugar1 star anise A few strips of lemon zest50ml rice-wine vinegar For the drink (per serve)35ml vodka (we use Grey Goose)25ml camomile tea cordial (see above and method)15ml pickled ginger juice (see above and method)5ml (1 tsp) fresh lemon juiceProsecco, to top (you’ll need about 50ml) Three or four days ahead, make the pickled ginger juice. Peel and finely grate the ginger. Bring the water to a boil in a small pan, then add the sugar, star anise and lemon peel, and stir over a low heat until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the ginger and vinegar, then pour into a Kilner jar or similar, and leave to steep for three to four days. Strain, discard the solids, then chill. Now for the cordial. Bring the water to a boil, pour this over the teabag in a mug or jug, and leave to steep for three or four minutes. Remove the teabag, then add the sugar and stir until it dissolves. Leave to cool, then chill. To build the drink, put a handful of ice in a shaker, add the vodka, cordial, pickled ginger juice and lemon juice, and shake hard. Strain into a champagne flute, top with prosecco and serve. • Alessandro Viscardi, senior bartender, Allegra, London E20
