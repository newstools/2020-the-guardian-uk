It’s been a summer like no other. Going on holiday after months of lockdown felt both special and strange. Millions opted to stay in the UK, snapping up rural camping pitches and cottages. Some were lucky enough to dodge the quarantine roulette and make it abroad. We would love to hear about your post-lockdown trip. Tell us about the best bits – or the worst! – giving as much detail as possible about where you were and what you did. If you have taken a great photograph of the experience, please feel free to send it in – though it is your tip that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 8 September at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
