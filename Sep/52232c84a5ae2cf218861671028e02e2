Sir Terence Conran, the designer, retailer and restaurateur who “revolutionised the way we live in Britain” has died. Conran, who was 88, passed away peacefully on Saturday in his Barton Court home, his family announced. Conran is perhaps best known as the founder of Habitat, which sought to bring to 1960s London a “new, European way to shop for contemporary homeware”. The chain eventually formed the foundations of a retailing empire including brands such as Mothercare, Heals, Richard Shops and British Home Stores. His family described him as a “visionary who enjoyed an extraordinary life and career that revolutionised the way we live in Britain”. He was also said to be a proud patriot, who “promoted the best of British design, culture and the arts around the world, and at the heart of everything he did was a very simple belief that good design improves the quality of people’s lives”. Among Conran’s proudest achievements was founding London’s Design Museum in 1989. Through its activities he was a “relentless champion of the importance of education to young people in the creative industries”. “In his private life he was adored by his family and friends and we will miss him dearly,” the family statement added. “It gives us great comfort to know that many of you will mourn with us but we ask that you celebrate Terence’s extraordinary legacy and contribution to the country he loved so dearly.”
