West Ham’s captain, Mark Noble, has said he is “sad and angry” after West Brom completed the permanent signing of the winger Grady Diangana from the London club. Noble tweeted his disapproval of the loss of a player with Diangana’s potential, writing: “As captain of this football club I’m gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!” The post was liked by teammate Declan Rice, who has been a target for Chelsea this summer. As captain of this football club I’m gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!! https://t.co/oNPPEp8Pt6 Diangana spent last season on loan at the Hawthorns as Slaven Bilic’s side sealed promotion to the Premier League and he has returned on a five-year deal. The 22-year-old scored eight goals in 30 appearances for West Brom and the England Under-21 international is excited to make his mark in the top flight. He said: “I know I can bring more to the game and to the team. I’m still young and last year was like my first season in senior football. I feel I am only going to get better. “And I believe in the style of football we play under Slaven. I think we will be suited for the challenge ahead because if you can’t keep the ball in the Premier League it will be tough. We have the quality to do that and compete and if we go with the ambition of doing well and not just surviving we can exceed some people’s expectations.”
