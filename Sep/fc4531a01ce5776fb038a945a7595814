For 10 years Martin Oâ€™Neill (obituary, 8 September) and I shared an office in the House of Lords. I marvelled at his grasp of whatever he undertook: whether as shadow spokesman on defence or energy, he was always unflappable. This and his sense of humour made him for me the ideal person to work alongside. If Labour had returned to power earlier he would have made a great cabinet minister.
