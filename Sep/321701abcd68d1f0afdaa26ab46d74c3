Have you had to change travel plans to avoid quarantine? Holiday makers in Portugal face a 14 day quarantine when returning to Scotland and Wales as coronavirus cases reached levels considered dangerous by the UK government. In Scotland, travellers from Greece already have to quarantine, whereas in Wales, this only applies to those arriving from a number of Greek destinations including the island of Zante. Gibraltar has also been added to the list. There is no requirement for English tourists in Portugal and Greece to quarantine upon returning. We’d like to hear from holidaymakers in Portugal and Greece who are changing plans because of the potential move. Are you trying to come back early? Will you have to cancel your planned holiday?
