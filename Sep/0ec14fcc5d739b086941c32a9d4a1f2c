Riot police detained hundreds of women as opposition protesters marched through the Belarusian capital, Minsk, demanding an end to President Alexander Lukashenko’s rule. About 2,000 women took part in the “Sparkly March”, wearing shiny accessories and carrying the red-and-white flags of the protest movement. Police blocked the women and began dragging them into police vans as they stood with linked hands, swiftly detaining several hundred, an AFP journalist saw. The march was the latest in a series of all-women protests calling for the strongman leader to leave after his disputed victory in elections last month. His opposition rival Svetlana Tikhanovskaya also claimed victory. In a statement released before the march, Tikhanovskaya, who has taken refuge in Lithuania, praised the “brave women of Belarus”. “They are marching despite being constantly menaced and put under pressure,” she said. Among those detained on Saturday was Nina Baginskaya, a 73-year-old activist who has become one of the best-known faces of the protest movement. Police released her outside a police station shortly afterwards. Police detained so many protesters that they ran out of room in vans, releasing about 10 women. Ambulances were called after several women became unwell during the detentions. The opposition is due to hold mass demonstrations on Sunday.
