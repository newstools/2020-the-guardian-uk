We never needed The Great British Bake Off more than we do now. This is partly because, in this age of frightening uncertainty, Bake Off‚Äôs spirit of good-natured fun feels like a warm tight hug. And also, based on last night‚Äôs episode, this year‚Äôs series is going to be flat-out barmy. Because last night‚Äôs showstopper was like no other. Last night, the bakers had to pay tribute to their heroes via the medium of cake. Was this because the producers wanted something touching and heartfelt? Or, as I suspect, had they just seen Lionel Richie‚Äôs Hello video for the first time and decided to replicate it across 15 minutes of breathtaking television? We may never know. However, the cakes deserve to be remembered ‚Ä¶ and ranked: Freddie Mercury‚Äôs head exploded‚Ä¶ but the Dough Must Go On! #GBBO pic.twitter.com/hlEdJpbxKC I have a real soft spot for this cake. Does it look like the real Freddie Mercury? No. But does it look like Freddie Mercury if Freddie Mercury was a Pokemon with breasts? Yes. And for that reason I‚Äôm in.

On the downside, her cake ended up looking like a Doctor Who baddie from one of those episodes where they realise halfway through production that they don‚Äôt have any money. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to have seen a mouth on it,‚Äù said Paul Hollywood, the sex-obsessed deviant.

Nobody can really recall what Marie Antoinette looked like in real life, so he could have made his cake look like anything and the judges would be none the wiser. However, he made the mistake of making it look like a haunted waxwork. ‚ÄúYou instantly recognise who it is,‚Äù said Paul Hollywood, the absolute liar.

The Chris Hoy we all know is an Olympic cyclist. However, on the basis of Peter‚Äôs cake, I cannot rule out the possibility of there being a second Sir Chris Hoy, who is a sort of limbless robot mutant sex doll. If there is, Peter got this one bang on the money. ‚ÄúVery dramatic,‚Äù noted Prue, who appears to be legally prohibited from using the word ‚Äúcrap‚Äù.

Had he done the smart thing and told the judges at the last minute that he was actually making a cake of Yoda reenacting Steve Buscemi‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow do you do, fellow kids‚Äù meme, he probably would have won the series there and then. Honestly, it‚Äôs uncanny. Likeness: 3Cake appeal: 4.5Fear factor: 7Total: 14.5 pic.twitter.com/yMHeT5PxCY Officially this cake was called Ode to Attenborough. This felt like a loophole because it looked nothing like David Attenborough. It also looked nothing like Richard Attenborough. Was she trying to suggest that there was a secret third Attenborough brother, who had been locked away in a shed to avoid terrifying people with his monstrous resemblance to a prop from an unmade 1940s sci-fi movie entitled The Granny With the Obliterated Face? We may never know.

That‚Äôs easy: make him look like a sort of wildly obese horse who has been banned from seeing sunlight by an evil Human Centipede-style surgeon.

But where Loriea fell down was by providing a photo of the real woman. And, since the real woman didn‚Äôt look anything like the radioactive market-stall ET that Loriea baked, she was doomed from the outset.

Either way he messed up, because in reality the finished cake could only be described as ‚ÄúAlbino Thanos‚Äù.

That can be the only possible explanation for her cake, which looked a bit like diarrhoea in a dress.
