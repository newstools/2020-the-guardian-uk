Phil Neville has called up several uncapped players for England Women’s training camp later this month, with Chelsea’s Niamh Charles and Katie Zelem of Manchester United among the 30-player squad. With several of his senior players unavailable for the seven-day camp at St George’s Park due to coronavirus travel restrictions, Neville has used the opportunity to select defenders Lotte Wubben-Moy, Millie Turner and Esme Morgan, midfielders Ella Toone, Charles, Zelem and Liverpool forward Rinsola Babajide for the first time. “This is a critical moment in our development of England Women,” said Neville. “It is important that we offer as many opportunities as possible for some of the country’s best young talent to stake their claim for a place in the senior England squad.” He added: “All the youngsters who have been given their opportunity today are extremely deserving of their senior call-ups, having performed strongly at club level and through England’s development teams. Now is their opportunity to prove themselves at senior international level and I am excited to see the blend of youthful ambition and senior experience.” The camp will be the first time England’s squad has assembled since the defeat to Spain at the SheBelieves Cup in March.
