Mason Greenwood has issued an unreserved apology for inviting a woman to England’s team hotel in Iceland, with the forward directing this in particular at Gareth Southgate for “letting down” the manager. The Manchester United forward was sent home by Southgate on Monday with Manchester City’s Phil Foden, who also invited a woman to a room at the hotel. In a statement on the club website Greenwood said: “Having now had the chance to reflect on what’s happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused. It was irresponsible of me to break the Covid-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public. “In particular, I want to apologise to Gareth Southgate, for letting him down, when he had shown great trust in me. Playing for England was one of the proudest moments in my life and I only have myself to blame for this huge mistake. I promise my family, the fans, Manchester United and England that this is a lesson I will learn from.” Greenwood does not have to quarantine because Iceland is not on the UK government travel restriction list, meaning he is free to resume training with Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad. The 18-year-old may face disciplinary action from United for an episode that the club on Monday characterised as “disappointing”.
