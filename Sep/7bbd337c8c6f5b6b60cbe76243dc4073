Aston Villa have signed Ross Barkley on a season’s loan from Chelsea. The 26-year-old midfielder has made three appearances in this campaign, scoring once, and was an unused substitute against Tottenham on Tuesday. “Capturing a player of Ross’s quality is a real coup for our club and I am certain he will thrive here and improve our team,” said Villa’s manager, Dean Smith. Barkley’s move ends any prospect of Villa signing Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan from Chelsea. Barkley moved to Stamford Bridge from Everton in January 2018 and has made 86 appearances for the club, scoring 11 goals. The England international will be unavailable for Thursday’s Carabao Cup visit of Stoke, having played in the competition for Chelsea. Smith’s team have won their opening two Premier League games and Barkley could make his debut against Liverpool on Sunday. Villa have broken their transfer record to sign Ollie Watkins from Brentford in a deal worth up to £33m, and bought Bertrand Traoré from Lyon for £17m this month, having spent £20m to bring the goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez from Arsenal.
