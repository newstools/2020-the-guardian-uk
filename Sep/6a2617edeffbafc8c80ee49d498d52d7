Lazio have agreed a deal with Manchester United to sign Andreas Pereira on loan for the 2020-21 season with an option to buy the midfielder for €27m (£24.5m) next summer. The Serie A side has tried to reach an agreement for the 24-year-old Brazil international for some time and, with time running out before the window closes, the two clubs agreed a deal that will see Lazio pay more than half of the player’s salary for the upcoming campaign. United are in need of selling or loaning out players as they hope to sign the Porto left-back Alex Telles and consider making an official bid for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho. Leeds United, meanwhile, are making progress in their pursuit of the Bayern Munich midfielder Michaël Cuisance. Personal terms have been agreed with the 21-year-old Frenchman for a contract until 2025 and Leeds have lodged a €20m bid with the European champions.
