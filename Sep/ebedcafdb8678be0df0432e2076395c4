In 1993 the Judicial Studies Board (now Judicial College) conducted a series of racial awareness seminars under the leadership of Mr Justice (later Lord) Dyson. All judges were required to attend. Many, including me, thought they were wholly unnecessary and a slighting of our professional dignity. We were quite wrong and had our eyes opened wide to our unconscious bias. Equality training developed in later years and is an essential part of judicial training. It is wretched, but only too predictable, to see MPs mouthing the same kind of objections that judges were finished with 27 years ago (MPs urged to do unconscious bias training as dozens of Tories set to reject it, 21 Septmember). Party leaders have to get a grip.His Honour Paul CollinsHorton-cum-Studley, Oxfordshire • MPs are obliged to represent all of their constituents and should determine their position on any issue after taking into account all of the available evidence. Prejudice can only damage this process, and every effort should be made to exclude it. Any MP who isn’t prepared to examine their own prejudices renders themselves unsuitable for the office they hold.Michael CooperHowden, East Riding of Yorkshire • Join the conversation – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit theguardian.com/letters
