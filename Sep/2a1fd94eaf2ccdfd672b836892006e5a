When the Race Relations Board was established by the Race Relations Act 1965 I was fortunate enough to be appointed as its legal adviser. I soon met Anthony Lester, a young barrister who had pressed for it with CARD (the Campaign against Racial Discrimination). Anthony had persuaded the home secretary, Roy Jenkins, to adopt the American model: a civil rather than criminal remedy for discrimination embodying a conciliation process managed by an independent board. Our collaboration on a field of law entirely new to Britain resulted in a book, Race and Law (1972).
