David Capel, the former Northamptonshire and England all-rounder, has died aged 57 following a long illness, the county has announced. Capel, who played 15 Tests and 23 one-day internationals for England, had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2018 and passed away at his home on Wednesday. Northamptonshire said on their Twitter account: “It is with incredibly heavy hearts that we announce the death of former Northamptonshire and England great, David Capel at the age of 57.” Capel represented the county for his entire playing career between 1981 and 1998, making 270 first-class appearances, scoring 10,869 runs and taking 467 wickets, while he played a further 300 List A matches. He became the first Northamptonshire-born cricketer to represent England at Test level in 77 years when he faced Pakistan in the summer of 1987. Capel registered a half-century on debut and 98 at Karachi in his fourth Test but he averaged just 15.58 whilehis 21 wickets came at a cost of 50.66. The end of his playing days led to him running the Northants academy and in 2006 he was appointed as the club’s head coach, overseeing their run to Twenty20 finals day three years later. In 2011, they came within a whisper of promotion to Division One of the County Championship but they were pipped by one point by Surrey. A 33-year association between Northants and Capel came to an end in 2012, after which he had a stint as assistant coach of the England Women’s team. The ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, told the county’s website: “This is hugely shocking and sad news for the English Cricket family and particularly those connected with Northants CCC. David was one of the finest all-rounders of his era and spent an astonishing 33 years at Wantage Rd. “I had the privilege of playing with David, a hugely competitive and determined cricketer who was never beaten – an attitude he took into his battle with his illness. A complex and private man on the surface, a kind and gentle one to those who knew him well. I will miss his friendship.”
