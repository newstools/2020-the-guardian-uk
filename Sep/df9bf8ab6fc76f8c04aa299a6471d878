Over a career in football spanning four decades, Arsène Wenger changed the game for ever. Known as le Professeur, he popularised a holistic approach to training, encouraging young players and looking at diet and mindset as well as physical drills. Born in Strasbourg in 1949, Wenger’s love of the game came from his father who managed the village team. He went on to play for local amateur clubs during the 80s before training as a manager. He worked with teams in France, Monaco and Japan before moving to the UK to manage Arsenal in 1996, where he remained until 2018. When he arrived at Arsenal, headlines read: “Arsène Who?”, but his time at the London club made him world famous. His achievements included an undefeated domestic league season and a record number of FA Cups. He became known for his determined pursuit of often glorious, free-flowing football. To celebrate the publication next month of Wenger’s autobiography, My Life in Red and White, the Observer New Review will put questions to “le Prof” from readers and famous fans. Which player does he consider his best signing, perhaps? Were there any Premier League managers he genuinely couldn’t stand? Did he leave Arsenal at the right time? Any guilty pleasures? What TV does he watch? Submit your question in the form below, email it to review@observer.co.uk or tweet @ObsNewReview by 8 September If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
