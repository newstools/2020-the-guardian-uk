For the past decade, Hilary Mantel has enthralled readers with her epic trilogy of Tudor novels: Wolf Hall, Bring Up the Bodies and, most recently, The Mirror and the Light. Not only did these works make her the first woman to win two Booker prizes – they might yet bag her a third – they transformed the cosy, middlebrow image of historical fiction into something altogether darker and more disturbing. Born in Derbyshire in 1952, Mantel struggled with debilitating illness in her 20s before publishing her first book, Every Day Is Mother’s Day, in 1985. She went on to earn plaudits for a string of novels but it was not until she turned to the story of Thomas Cromwell that she achieved real celebrity. The RSC’s smash-hit stage adaptation of the first two books, followed by the BBC mini-series featuring Mark Rylance, cemented her status as a literary superstar. Next month sees the publication of Mantel Pieces: Royal Bodies and Other Writing from the London Review of Books, a collection of essays and memoir written over 30 years. To mark the occasion, the Observer New Review will put questions to Mantel from readers and famous fans. Was it stressful to have her last book so eagerly awaited, perhaps? Is she serious when she says she won’t write historical fiction again? And what does she think of the flight of Meghan and Harry? Any writers she loves? Or hates?
