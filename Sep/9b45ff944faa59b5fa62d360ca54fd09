Sergio Ramos scored twice as Spain surged to the top of Nations League A’s Group 4 with a 4-0 win over Ukraine in Madrid. Ramos gave his side the lead with a third-minute penalty, then doubled it just before the half-hour. Ansu Fati quickly stretched the home side’s advantage and Manchester City’s new signing Ferran Torres added a fourth late on. Spain had begun their campaign with a draw in Germany, who had to settle for a share of the points again, this time in Switzerland. Another City player, Ilkay Gündogan, gave the Germans a first-half lead but Silvan Widmer levelled for the Swiss. Russia have maximum points from their first two games in League B’s Group 3 after resisting Hungary’s revival in Budapest. Anton Miranchuk, Magomed Ozdoyev and Mário Fernandes put Russia 3-0 up early in the second half before Roland Sallai and Nemanja Nikolic reduced the deficit but Hungary were unable to force an equaliser. Serbia and Turkey played out a goalless draw in the group’s other game. In League C’s Group 3, Greece and Slovenia are level on top after wins over Kosovo and Macedonia respectively, while the Faroe Islands lead Group 1 of League D after a 1-0 win in Andorra. Elsewhere in the group Malta and Latvia drew 1-1.
