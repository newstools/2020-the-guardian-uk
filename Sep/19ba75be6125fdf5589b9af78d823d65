It’s not often that the Guardian moves me to tears, but Elliot Dallen’s maturity and wisdom did (At 31, I have just weeks to live. Here’s what I want to pass on, 7 September). I developed testicular cancer at 24 and, after surgery and radiotherapy, wondered how long my life might be. I am now 70 with two sons and five grandchildren. I recently retired from the NHS after 47 years and, although I have a radiation-stiff spine, I am, to my surprise, still here. Am I privileged? I most certainly am. Thank you for reminding me, Elliot.Dr Julian BradleyRichmond, London • As a family we read Elliot Dallen’s article with sadness, but also with appreciation and a feeling of comfort. Two years ago we lost our beloved son, Matthew, to a brain tumour. Sadly, at the end of his life, he was unable to speak or write. But we know that if he had been able to communicate, he would almost certainly have said all the things Elliot said: travelling; helping others; making the most of every minute; learning new skills; enjoying family and friendships. Matthew certainly did all these until he became too ill. We felt that Elliot had articulated what Matthew would have liked to say. Thank you.Marcia ThompsonFormby, Merseyside • It has taken me 82 years and my own experience of cancer to come to the same conclusions as Elliot Dallen about what counts in life. I had been looking for a charity to which I could donate the money I saved on hairdressing during lockdown. No contest now.Alma CullenEdinburgh • Join the conversation – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
