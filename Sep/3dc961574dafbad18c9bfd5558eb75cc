Kim Kardashian West criticised Instagram and Facebook for allowing the “spreading of hate” and said she would freeze her social media accounts on the platforms. Actors including Kerry Washington, Jennifer Lawrence, Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Ruffalo also posted in support of the #StopHateForProfit campaign and called on Facebook to do more. The reality TV star added that inaccurate social media posts have “a serious impact on our elections and undermines our democracy”, and urged others to also suspend their accounts for 24 hours on Wednesday over the companies’ failure to tackle hate speech. Kardashian West tweeted: “I love that I can connect directly with you through Instagram and Facebook, but I can’t sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda and misinformation – created by groups to sow division and split America apart – only to take steps after people are killed,” she said.

Kardashian West has 188 million Instagram followers, while her Facebook page has been liked by more than 29 million people. The Stop Hate for Profit campaign, launched earlier this year, has also won the support of dozens of major companies in an advertising boycott of Facebook. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has previously said it is taking steps to tackle disinformation online. Both platforms have been contacted for comment.
