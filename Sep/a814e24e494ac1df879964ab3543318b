In 1961, I consulted Audrey Newsome about my floundering career plans. She arranged for me to meet Marion Frank, then head of the school and department of radiography at the Middlesex hospital, in central London. This led to my 40-plus years in the profession and the NHS, and I suspect many others were grateful for her interest and remarkable expertise.
