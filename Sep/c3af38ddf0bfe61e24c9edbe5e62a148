Leeds return to the top flight after an absence of 5,964 days at the champions, who are unbeaten at Anfield for three successive seasons and are four games shy of equalling the club record of 63 home league games without defeat. Liverpool have scored at least three goals in every opening game under Jürgen Klopp but Marcelo Bielsa, fresh from signing a new one-year contract, will pose a fresh conundrum.
