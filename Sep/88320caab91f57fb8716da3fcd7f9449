Paris Saint-Germain have made a bid of £25m plus £5m in add-ons for the Arsenal right-back Héctor Bellerín. The French club were in almost daily contact with Arsenal last week and they have now made a move as they seek to strengthen after their Champions League final defeat against Bayern Munich. Bayern, too, have shown an interest in Bellerín this summer and so have Juventus. The 25-year-old is under contract until June 2023. It adds up to a teaser for the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, who has spent £41m in fees already this summer on Pablo Mari from Flamengo and Lille’s Gabriel Magalhães. He has also signed the free agents Cedric Soares and Willian and, with book-balancing a pre-requisite in straitened times for the club, it is expected he will have to sell somebody at some point. Arsenal are willing to listen to offers for a host of players although Bellerín, ideally, is one Arteta would want to keep. It remains to be seen whether the club can generate the funds they need from the sale of players that are further down the pecking order.
