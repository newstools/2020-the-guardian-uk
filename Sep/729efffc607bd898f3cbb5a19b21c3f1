Serves 4 as a first course or 3 as a mainchicken or vegetable stock 1¼ litresunsalted butter 60golive oil 1 tbspshallots 2, very finely choppedcelery stick 1, very finely choppedItalian rice 300g, preferably arborioorganic lemon ½fresh sage leaves 5 or 6fresh rosemary leaves a small sprigegg yolk 1parmesan 4 tbsp, freshly grateddouble cream 4 tbspsea salt and freshly ground black pepper Bring the stock to a gentle simmer (keep it simmering all through the cooking of the rice). Heat half the butter, the oil, shallots and celery in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and saute until the soffritto – frying mixture – of shallot and celery is softened (about 7 minutes). Mix in the rice and continue to sauté, stirring, until the rice is well coated with the fats and is partly translucent. Pour over about 150ml of the simmering stock. Stir very thoroughly and cook until the rice has absorbed nearly all of the stock, still stirring. Add another ladleful of simmering stock, and continue in this manner until the rice is ready. You may not need all the stock. Good-quality Italian rice for risotto takes 15-20 minutes to cook. Meanwhile, thinly pare the zest from the lemon half and chop it with the herbs. Mix into the rice halfway through the cooking. Squeeze the half lemon into a small bowl and combine it with the egg yolk, parmesan, cream, a little salt and a very generous grinding of black pepper. Mix well with a fork. When the rice is al dente, draw the pan off the heat and stir in the egg and cream mixture and the remaining butter. Cover the pan and leave to rest for 2 minutes or so. Then give the risotto an energetic stir, transfer to a heated dish or bowl and serve at once, with more grated parmesan in a little bowl if you wish.From Italian Kitchen by Anna del Conte (Square Peg, £20)
