‘Design’ is a word used to describe architecture and products, ideas and visual arts. Design makes your sofa comfortable, but it can also save the planet if you’re developing innovative building materials. In this age, every aspect of design is considered by a switched-on reader, so the Design Review newsletter focuses on thinking and process as much as products to buy. The way we think about lifestyle is changing. As our focus turns to sustainability and away from the short fix of fashion and trends, we have updated our lifestyle journalism to reflect this. Following on from our quarterly Design magazine, we’ve launched a monthly newsletter to bring you more of these features and stories. If you want to read more about the world of underground parks, post-modern cakes and algae T-shirts, sign up now. The future is waiting. *** Explore all our newsletters: whether you love film, football, fashion or food, we’ve got something for you *** The Guardian’s newsletters include content from our website, which may be funded by outside parties.Newsletters may also display information about Guardian News and Media’s other products, services or events (such as Guardian Jobs or Masterclasses), chosen charities or online advertisements.
