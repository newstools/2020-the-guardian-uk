Martin Kettle concludes his article (This Brexit bill finally buries the Conservative party of law and order, 9 September) by suggesting that “the government actively seeks disorder” and that this is “a very different kind of Tory party from any of its predecessors”. Surely this is the point? The party that governs this country is not the Conservative party, but the Cuckoo party, which, like its avian cousins, has no scruples about ejecting the legitimate occupants of the “nest” to further its interests. The cuckoos are an evolved species of the Farageist breed, led by an unelected algorithm, controlling a puppet, to manipulate the public and party. Boris Johnson is the ideal frontman. Together, using the Conservative label, they have succeeded in occupying the space of authentic Conservatives to deliver a version of the party that bears no resemblance to the original model. No wonder regions are now considering secession from the union. Unless parliamentarians of all parties unite to drive these interlopers out, England will be reduced to an isolated, corrupt, poverty-stricken outpost of an empowered EU.
