A new chapter begins for Pokémon in the UK on Tuesday as the animated series Pokémon Journeys starts on the Freeview channel POP. Ash and Pikachu have been on our screens since the 1990s, and the Pokémon franchise includes not just the anime, but video games, trading cards, lots and lots of toys and even a live action movie. But how much do you know about the world of Pokémon. Test yourself with our quiz … Pokémon Journeys begins on POP on Tuesday 1 September, and then airs every day at 6.30pm. There’s no prizes for the quiz, it’s just for fun, but if you do feel there is an egregious error bad enough that you demand to speak to the quizmaster, you can email martin.belam@theguardian.com
