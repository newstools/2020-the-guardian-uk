Pizza Hut Restaurants said: “We are doing everything we can to redeploy our team members from our Pizza Hut Restaurants locations that are at the highest risk of closure and minimise the impact to our workforce.” The spokesperson said it was not possible to confirm the exact number of job losses at each restaurant, adding: “We understand this is a difficult time for everyone involved and are supporting our team members as much as possible throughout this transition.” The planned closures and redundancies follow similar moves at Pizza Express and Azzurri Group, the owner of Ask Italian and Zizzi, Carluccio’s and the Casual Dining Group, which owns Bella Italia, Café Rouge, and Las Iguanas. Pizza and pasta specialists were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic after overexpansion led to oversaturation of the market.

In 2020, the restaurant trade has taken another heavy blow as high street lockdowns, physical-distancing rules and fears over Covid-19 have hit trade, forcing cutbacks and closures by a string of well-established names.
