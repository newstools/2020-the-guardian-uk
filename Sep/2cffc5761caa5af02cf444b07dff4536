Four decades ago, when I was a researcher getting to grips with the complexities of the politics and physics of plutonium for my PhD, I contacted Frank Barnaby, then director of the peace research organisation Sipri in Stockholm. With characteristic good humour he found time in his busy schedule to share his knowledge. His lifeâ€™s work has made our planet a better and safer place, and I will be among many who will miss him.
