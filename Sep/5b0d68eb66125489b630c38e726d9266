Donald Trump has taken a swipe at the Duchess of Sussex and wished Prince Harry luck “because he’s going to need it”, after the couple urged Americans to vote in the upcoming US presidential election. “I’m not a fan of hers,” the president told reporters at a White House press briefing. “I would say this – and she probably has heard that – I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he’s going to need it.” It came after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex urged people in a video clip for Time magazine to “reject hate speech” in the 3 November election. Harry, who is not eligible to vote in the US, said: “As we approach this November, it’s vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity.” Meghan, who was born in California and who described the event as “the most important election of our lifetime”, said: “When we vote, our values are put into action, our voices are heard.” Although the couple did not mention Trump in the clip, or his election rival, Joe Biden, many have interpreted their comments as an effective endorsement of the Democratic candidate. The royal family does not vote in general elections, in order to convey political neutrality, and Buckingham Palace has distanced itself from Prince Harry’s comments. A palace spokesperson said: “The duke is not a working member of the royal family and any comments he makes are in a personal capacity.” Meghan, 39, and Harry, 36, moved to California earlier this year with their one-year-old son, Archie – following a stint in Canada – after announcing that they were stopping royal duties and working towards financial self-sufficiency. Earlier this week, the feminist activist Gloria Steinem revealed that Meghan had joined her in cold-calling Americans urging them to vote.
