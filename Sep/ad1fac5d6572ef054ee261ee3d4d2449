Many UK galleries and museum have now reopened – and they need our custom. And with pre-booked tickets and social distancing essential, this is a great time to visit, as they’re far less crowded than usual. Tell us about a place you love that’s open and why – perhaps there’s a specific exhibit or gallery room that’s worth seeing, or a little-known small museum that deserves a shout out. If you have taken a great photograph, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 6 October at 9am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
