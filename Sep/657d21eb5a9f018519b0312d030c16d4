I have two additions to your excellent article (How to stop your bicycle from being stolen, 28 August). First personalise your bike – in my case with flowers. My husband has put masking tape to hide all the manufacturer’s details. Paint works well. The second recommendation is Pinhead locks, which require a key to remove pedals, headset, saddle etc. This deters thieves since they would be unlikely to be able to sell the bike.Rosemary AikmanManchester • The movie meal that stays in my mind (Letters, 30 August) is in Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover: the deliciously cooked Alan Howard is stuffed with his own books and served to Michael Gambon in Le Hollandais restaurant by his unfaithful wife, Helen Mirren.Christine HawkesCambridge • Stuart Jeffries, reviewing a TV programme about Spurs, writes that it “comes from our boringly sanitised era of sports documentary” (31 August). No mention of the excruciatingly honest Sunderland ’Til I Die, which certainly doesn’t.John HuntleyManchester • Shortage of rightwing comedians (Rightwing comedians not funny enough for BBC shows, says insider, 1 September)?
