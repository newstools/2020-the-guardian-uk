Tributes have been paid to Winston Groom, the author of the novel Forrest Gump, who has died aged 77. His work was adapted into a 1994 blockbuster film starring Tom Hanks. Forrest Gump was a cultural sensation and grossed more than $683m (£527m) at the global box office on its way to winning six Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor for Hanks. Groom’s death was confirmed by Alabama governor Kay Ivey: “Saddened to learn that Alabama has lost one of our most gifted writers,” she said. “While he will be remembered for creating Forrest Gump, Winston Groom was a talented journalist & noted author of American history. Our hearts & prayers are extended to his family.” Groom graduated from the University of Alabama in 1965 before a spell in the US Army, which included a tour of duty during the Vietnam war. In its tribute, the university called him “one of our legends”. Following the success of Forrest Gump, Groom wrote a follow-up in 1995 called Gump and Co. As well as fiction, Groom, a former journalist, also wrote non-fiction on a range of subjects, including the American civil war.
