Toots Hibbert, frontman of reggae group Toots and the Maytals, has been admitted to an intensive care unit in a Jamaican hospital with a possible case of Covid-19. A statement from his family said Hibbert was waiting for the results of a coronavirus test: “While reports of Mr Hibbert being in an intensive care unit at a private facility in the Corporate Area are true, the family would like to assure those concerned that he is making positive progress and is receiving the best possible treatment, while he awaits the results on his Covid-19 test. He is resting and in good spirits, and is showing signs of improvement by the hour.” His manager told the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper that Hibbert was suffering from respiratory issues. Hibbert, 77, is one of the most lauded figures in his country’s musical history, helping to pioneer the bright offbeat rhythms of reggae music in the mid-60s, including the high-tempo ska style. Tracks including Pressure Drop, Funky Kingston and Monkey Man are classics of the genre. Toots and the Maytals released their first album in a decade last week. Got to Be Tough includes a take on Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds with Marley’s son Ziggy.
