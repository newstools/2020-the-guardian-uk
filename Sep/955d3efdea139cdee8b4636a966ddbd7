One of the few beneficial side-effects of the pandemic is that many of us have been taking more notice of the wildlife on our doorsteps, from raptors and waders to hedgehogs and even orcas. Animals became emboldened as sites usually busy with visitors stayed closed for much of the year – stoats, weasels and badgers were reported visiting the gardens of national houses. Special interest groups have popped up on social media to share sightings, such as the Self Isolating Bird Club on Facebook, and people have been downloading apps to identify plants and bird calls on their mobile phones. So, this week we’d like you to share your best nature spots of the spring and summer. Were you one of the lucky few to see orcas in Strangford Lough, owls at Ham House, or Kashmiri goats in Llandudno? Please ensure your tip stays at about 100 words.
