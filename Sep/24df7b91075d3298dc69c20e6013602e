Last modified on Mon 28 Sep 2020 12.57 BST The shocking claim that Donald Trump paid only $750 in federal taxes has dominated headlines after a New York Times report into his financial affairs, but it is far from the only surprising sum exposed by the documents. Here are some of the key figures: $750 Federal tax Trump paid in 2016, when he won the presidency. $750 Federal tax Trump paid the following year. Zero Federal tax paid by Trump in 10 of the previous 15 years, including 2014 and 2015. $100,000 a year By comparison, the kind of figure regularly paid in federal taxes by Trump’s predecessors, Barack Obama and George W Bush $70,000 Paid to style Trump’s hair for television, claimed as expenses. $95,464 The total sum nine of Trump’s companies have paid as expenses to style Ivanka Trump’s hair. $210,000 The amount written off as expenses to hire a photographer taking photographs at the Mar-a-Lago club. $26m “Consulting fees” charged as a business expense between 2010 and 2018, at least some of which appears to have been directed to a company co-owned by Ivanka Trump. $434m What Trump declared his earnings to be in the 2018 presidential public annual financial disclosure. $47.4m in losses What he had declared to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax purposes over the same period. $421m Outstanding loans that Trump owes, most of which becomes due within the next four years. $73m Revenue generated from outside the US, presenting a potential conflict of interest with US foreign policy. $13m Earned in one licensing deal for Trump Towers in Istanbul, including $1m since he became president. $72.9m The tax refund Trump claimed and was awarded, which is now the subject of a decade-long audit battle with the IRS. It covered all the federal tax he had paid between 2005 and 2008. $1.4m The annual average amount of federal tax paid by Trump between 2000 and 2017. It compares with the $25m in federal income taxes the average American with similar declared earnings could expect to pay. $100m The amount Trump could now have to pay back to the IRS, including penalties, if it finds against him in the audit. $315m The sum reported “lost” by Trump’s golf courses since 2000. ‘Tens of millions of dollars’ What Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, claims the president has paid in personal taxes since 2015. More than 500 The number of individual companies, many bearing the Trump name, that make up the nebulous corporate network generally referred to as the Trump Organization. The president has denied the reports, describing them in a White House press conference on Sunday as “fake news”.
