Your editorial (6 September) suggests that the UN convention on the law of the sea supports both Greece and the status quo. That is not entirely accurate, as the same convention also refers to the principle of equity. Turkey has been inviting relevant parties to engage in negotiations based on international law and the principle of equity since 2003 for the delimitation of exclusive economic zones. Yet the Greek side has never engaged in sincere dialogue, in order to delay and avoid concrete negotiations. The latest attempts by Germany to bring about the resumption of talks were sabotaged by Greece twice – first by signing an agreement on the issue with Egypt, then refusing to talk to Turkey. Similarly, the recent efforts exerted by the Nato secretary general for initiating technical talks on deconfliction measures were again rejected by Greece. Turkey, on the other hand, supported these initiatives and is ready to engage in sincere talks.Ümit YalçınAmbassador of the Republic of Turkey
