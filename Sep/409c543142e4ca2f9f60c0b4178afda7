Whether it’s a lung-busting hill climb or along a gentle river path, out in the wilds or an interesting route through your home town or city, this week we want you to share your favourite run in the UK. We’re not looking for tips on park runs this week – we’ll save that category until they are up and running again – or fun runs, marathons and the like. We’re looking for routes that inspire you, one you think other runners will enjoy. If you have taken a great photograph of the route, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 22 September at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
