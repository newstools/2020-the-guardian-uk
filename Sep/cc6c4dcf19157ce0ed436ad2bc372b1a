Five people have been found dead and another with serious injuries following an early morning shooting in a home east of Toronto on Friday. A police spokesman said that neighbours reported the sound of gunshots from a home in Oshawa, Ontario, around 1.20am. Constable George Tudos said the dead include four men and one woman, two of whom were under 18. Tudos said officers also found a 50-year-old woman in the house with a gunshot wound and she was sent to a local hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Durham police said in a statement that the suspected perpetrator is believed to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and no other suspects are outstanding. Carol Gibson, who lives down the street from the crime scene, said she was startled awake by the incident. “The first shot woke me up, and then I heard about four or five more after that,″ Gibson said. “Then a woman screamed and there were two shots after that.” Gibson said she had known the family in the house for about 20 years. “They were a family that cared for each other quite a bit,” said Gibson. “If they weren’t playing baseball, hockey or shooting hoops on the driveway, they were out raking leaves and they did it as a family. A very caring family.″ Rob Mitchell, another neighbor, described them as kind and outgoing. “They are very, very involved with their kids and what they are doing in the community. It definitely doesn’t make any sense at all,” Mitchell said.
