Manager Brian Snitker was just hoping to shake up the Atlanta Braves’ lineup following a shutout loss. As it turned out, the new mix made National League history. Adam Duvall drove in nine runs with three homers, including a grand slam, and the Braves obliterated their franchise scoring record and set the NL record in a 29-9 romp over the Miami Marlins on Wednesday night. The Braves broke loose for 11 runs in the second and nearly matched the modern scoring mark since 1900, set by the Texas Rangers in a 30-3 rout of the Baltimore Orioles in 2007. The Braves scored 18 of their 29 runs via home runs 😱That ties the most runs scored via homers in a game in MLB history. pic.twitter.com/dA0OJZaxw3 “Pretty amazing,” said Freddie Freeman, who drove in six runs with three hits, including a two-run homer. “Hard to put into words, really, when you look up and see 29 runs on the board.” The Braves had 23 hits, including seven homers, to score the most runs in their history. They topped the old record by six runs. Duvall’s enormous night came exactly a week after he hit three home runs in a game at Boston. “I’ve never seen an offense click like that, all together,” Freeman said. Freeman said he woke up to a text from Snitker saying he’d be hitting second. Travis d’Arnaud had a three-run homer in the second as the new cleanup hitter. Freeman now expects to be hitting second again. “I would assume so,” Freeman said. “I think it would be very hard for him to change the lineup after scoring 29 runs.” Atlanta’s offensive outburst came one day after being shut out 8-0 by Miami for the Braves’ second straight loss in the series. The rout comes during an otherwise encouraging season for the Marlins. After years of underwhelming play, the team appear to have turned a corner and sit third in the NL East with a fair chance of making the playoffs. The Braves top the division.
