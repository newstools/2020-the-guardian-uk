With summer slipping away and autumn starting to turn trees all shades of red and gold, now is a great time to visit the UK’s woodlands. We’re looking for suggestions for woodland trails – whether it’s a gentle meander for all the family or a more challenging hike through forested hills. Tell us why it’s a favourite with you, and why other readers might like it, too. If you have taken a great photograph, please feel free to send it in – though it is your words that will be judged for the competition. Keep your tip to about 100 words. The best tip of the week, chosen by travel expert Tom Hall, will win a £200 voucher from glamping specialist Canopy & Stars, which has more than 700 places to stay amid nature. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to enter this competition. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The competition closes on 29 September at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
