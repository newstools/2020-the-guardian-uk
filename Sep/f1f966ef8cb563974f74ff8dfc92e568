The new Matildas away kit will be made available to supporters in a women’s cut after an initial bungle excluded a large section of the team’s fanbase – but the new sizes will not be on shelves until next year. The latest Nike-designed Australian national team kits, which are constructed entirely from recyclable material, were launched to much fanfare last week. The green away strip, however, is currently only available in a men’s silhouette. Football Federation Australia said the initial decision was not in line with its organisational views on gender equality and scrambled to correct the error, having admitted a mistake had been made. On Wednesday FFA confirmed its intention to make the kits available to all, with a rollout into shops expected in early 2021. “FFA, together with Nike, have listened to fans and consumers and as a result the away kit will be available for purchase early in the new year,” an FFA release said. “Women’s football and gender equality is a fundamental strategic pillar for FFA. Principle X of the XI Principles for the future of Australian football demonstrates our renewed commitment to women’s football and places it at the heart of the continued growth and development of Australian football. “The initial unavailability of 2020 national teams away kits in a women’s silhouette was not consistent with the values in which FFA seeks to uphold and promote. FFA acknowledges this, and will place added emphasis on ensuring that future processes are aligned with the organisation’s broader vision and mission for the sport.” Upon last year’s launch of the previous kit – a homage to the popular 1990s “spew” kit that the Matildas wore at the Women’s World Cup in France – the men’s cut quickly sold out. Fans wanting to get hold of the latest shirt in a women’s cut have been invited to express their interest on an online form to avoid disappointment.
