Yes, Chuck D has earned the right to make as much average music as he wants. What’s dispiriting is that the genius who devised the deathless definition of rap as the black CNN remains so stuck on the History channel. This is an uneasy mix of songs gussied up from a 2017 giveaway album and weird microaggressions towards 80s classics such as Public Enemy No 1. Half man, half megaphone even at 60, Chuck is a very specific talent who feeds on combative backing tracks forged to fit his voice. A parade of golden age guests – B-Real, Ice-T, Run-DMC – looks great on the credits, yet even Nas struggles with Fight the Power: Remix 2020, sheepish rhymes swallowed whole by that ravenous, lupine Bomb Squad beat. PE have always had ideas, titles and lyrics that range from gauche and offensive to inspirational and incendiary, but if deadnaming Caitlyn Jenner seemed a misstep in 2017 it feels deeply dumb now. And although Chuck has rightly criticised phallocentric US rap, there’s only room for two brief female features here. Some competent moments, especially the punchy State of the Union (STFU) and Go at It, but stronger editors should have whittled this down to a mixtape.
