I was interested to read about the extension of the custody time limit period in criminal cases awaiting trial (Custody time limit to be increased to ease court case backlog in England, 6 September). I retired earlier this year after 40 years as a criminal barrister, the last 12 of which were in the Crown Prosecution Service. What you describe are the delays after the case has finally reached court. What is not reported is the long delay between the date of the alleged offence and the first court appearance, in straightforward cases where most of the evidence is available on arrest. This has been two years or more on too many occasions. In one case, where a teenager was facing a potential sentence of three and a half to seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment according to sentencing guidelines, it was three years from arrest to first court appearance. Lack of resources and facilities are the main causes, however much judges express concern. The doctrine that justice delayed is justice denied is honoured in the breach rather than the observation. I can only imagine how much worse the situation is now as a result of Covid-19.Michael ConryWorcester
