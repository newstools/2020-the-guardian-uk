Two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies fatally shot a Black man who scuffled with them after they tried to stop him for riding a bicycle in an unlawful manner, authorities said. A crowd gathered and marched to the sheriff’s station after the Monday afternoon shooting, demanding justice. Sheriff’s lieutenant Brandon Dean said two deputies from the South Los Angeles station were driving when they saw a man riding his bicycle in violation of vehicle codes, according to the Los Angeles Times. It was not known which codes the man allegedly broke, Dean said. When deputies tried to stop the man he dropped his bike and ran with deputies in pursuit, Dean said. Deputies again tried to make contact with the man, who Dean said punched a deputy in the face. The man dropped a bundle of clothes and the deputies spotted a black handgun in the bundle, at which point both opened fire, Dean said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the handgun was recovered and no deputies were injured. Family members at the scene identified the dead man as Dijon Kizzee, 29, CBS-Los Angeles reported. Protesters demanded answers, and more than 100 people marched to a sheriff’s station on Imperial Highway. Some said they didn’t think the shooting was justified while others chanted, “Say his name” and “No justice, no peace”, the Times reported. Arlander Givens, 68, who lives in the neighborhood, questioned why deputies fired at a man who, according to the sheriff’s official, wasn’t holding a weapon. “If he reached down to grab it, that’s different,” Givens told the Times. “But if it’s on the ground, why shoot? That means he was unarmed.” The Los Angeles county sheriff’s department said multiple independent investigations began at the scene, as is customary with deputy-involved shootings.
