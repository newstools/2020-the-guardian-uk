Microsoft has confirmed that its Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X consoles will launch on 10 November. The former will be priced at £249 (and $299), the latter at £449 ($499). Pre-orders for both will be available from 22 September. The company was forced to announce its lower priced Xbox Series S machine on Tuesday after information was leaked on social media. The console will have less powerful specifications than the Xbox Series X but will offer next generation features such as fast load times, high frame rates and real-time ray-tracing. On Wednesday Microsoft announced the Xbox Series X pricing on its Xbox Wire website. Both machines will be available via the company’s Xbox All Access scheme, which is to provide the machine and access to its monthly video game subscription service, Game Pass, for £28.99 a month over 24 months for Xbox Series X and £20.99 a month for 24 months for Xbox Series S. These deals will be available in the UK only through retailers Game and Smyths. Microsoft also announced that membership of the Electronic Arts subscription service EA Play will be available at no extra cost to Game Pass subscribers, giving unlimited access to 60 EA titles including Fifa 20 and Titanfall 2. Sony is yet to reveal the price or release date for its rival PlayStation 5 console, which is also launching this winter and will be similarly available in two iterations – one with a disc drive and one without. Nintendo is also rumoured to be revealing a successor to its Switch console.
