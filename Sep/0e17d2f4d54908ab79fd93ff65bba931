Counter-terrorism police are investigating after a man was charged with attempted murder for allegedly slashing a policeman with a knife and injuring two other officers in Sydney’s CBD. Police were called after a food delivery rider was allegedly harassed by a man on George Street after midnight on Wednesday. It’s alleged one officer was slashed across his head and shoulder after a man pulled out a knife when they approached him as he was walking along York Street near Market Street. Another officer was slashed on the hand and a third officer was bitten on the arm, police say. The 32-year-old man was disarmed and arrested before being taken to St Vincent’s hospital for assessment. Detectives and the New South Wales joint counter-terrorism team later conducted a search warrant at a hostel on York Street and seized a number of items. The Lakemba man faces multiple charges, including grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, assaulting police and resisting arrest. He is expected to face court on Thursday. The injured officers were taken to St Vincent’s hospital, where a 40-year-old male senior constable was treated for a laceration to the left side of his head and a cut to his left shoulder. A 39-year-old male acting sergeant was treated for a cut to his finger and a knee injury while a 20-year-old male probationary constable was treated for a bite to his tricep.
