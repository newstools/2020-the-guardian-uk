High streets feel emptier than ever, yet there are queues outside supermarkets and anyone trying to book an online delivery faces a long wait. With the country relying upon supermarkets to keep us fed, we want to know how it feels to be working in one of these stores on the frontline. Has your health been affected and how are your colleagues? What is your workload like now and has your employer done enough to keep you safe? How is morale in your store? Are you taking pride in the essential work you are doing? Do you feel more appreciated and respected now than you were before? Have customers given you messages of support or thanks? Should we also be clapping for supermarket staff? Whether you work behind the counter, stacking shelves, as a delivery driver or providing security in stores, we want to hear from you. You can get in touch with us by filling in the encrypted form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses and one of our journalists may be in touch for more information if you are happy to be contacted. If you canâ€™t see the form, click here.
