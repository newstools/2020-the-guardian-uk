The impact of the coronavirus crisis could ripple through every layer of our social fabric. We want to hear what you are concerned about, hopeful for, or even looking forward to in a changed future, for a Guardian video series where we’ll discuss how life may change. What are the best things about our society that should be conserved for future generations, and where can we see a need for change? You can tell us your views and experiences in the encrypted form below. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian and we will feature some of your stories.
