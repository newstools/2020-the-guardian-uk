Though there is little live sport to gamble on and high street betting shops have closed, gambling charities are concerned that the combination of money worries, social isolation and having a lot of free time on our hands may lead to a spike in gambling addiction and debt. Horse racing and football, which make up 75% of the sports market in the UK, have both been suspended, yet GamCare, the UK’s leading charity for problem gamblers, recognise that the conditions under lockdown may exacerbate our desire to gamble online. “Contributing factors to the addiction, such as financial distress, isolation and boredom, are increasing with Covid-19 and the government measures,” said GamCare chief executive Anna Hemmings.
