Locked down in a city? What can you see out of the window? We would love you to share your photos of the wildlife you can see from your home. Did a fox just dart out into the road? Is there a bumble bee sidling up to your 10th floor flat? Can you see a rare flower pushing its way up in a crack in the pavement? Cities are full of flora and fauna and with the streets largely empty of traffic and people the signs of urban wildlife are more evident than ever. Show us us your photos and tell us about them in up to 100 words so we can record the biodiversity thriving in our cities. What urban wildlife can you see from where you are?
