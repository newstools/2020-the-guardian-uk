I supported Bill Bailey on tour for a while and his shows are sublime. But it’s got to be Robin Williams Live at the Met. When I was a teenager I knew every word of it and quoted it constantly. The Day Today. “Where now for man raised by puffins?” “‘I’m so sorry’ yells exploding cleaner.” And “headmaster suspended for using big-faced child as satellite dish”. This is the TV show that introduced me to Alan Partridge – though he was on On the Hour first, of course, on the radio. Blazing Saddles. It has more jokes in it than any other film and makes me howl every time I watch it. Rob Rouse – he makes me giggle like a fool. He was in Upstart Crow in the West End when the virus came for us all. Now he’s racing chickens in the Peak District on Twitter and Instagram. I asked someone to say which was best – Byron or Five Guys (the burger shops) and she genuinely believed I was asking her to choose between the poet Byron and the musical Five Guys Named Moe. Cheese fondue (homemade) at Glastonbury with Phill Jupitus. We dunked mini pork pies in when we ran out of bread. I was a Robert Smith wannabe goth, so fluffy, spiky hedgehog style. That the Edinburgh fringe might still somehow happen in 2020. Madness! Did you hear about the inflatable boy at the inflatable school who was sent to see the inflatable headmistress for bringing in a pin? She said: “You’ve let me down, you’ve let yourself down, but worst of all you’ve let the school down.” Marcus Brigstocke’s new series, Jazz Family Trees, is on Jazz FM, Saturday 11 April, 9pm
