This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from Compton Verney art gallery and park, in Warwickshire. The gallery is home to six diverse collections from around the world including British folk art; the Marx-Lambert collection; Chinese bronzes, including objects from the Neolithic and Shang periods; British portraiture including paintings of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and Edward VI; northern European art (1450-1650); and Neapolitan art (1600-1800).
