Ron Davie and I served as trustees of Eden Valley hospice, Carlisle. When I joined it in 2000, Ron was chairing the board. Shortly before he had commissioned the Royal College of Physicians to undertake a review of the hospice that proved to be a key step in improving and developing it as a much valued service for the communities of north Cumbria. Ron also led research into the need for hospice services for children and young people with life-threatening conditions in Cumbria. Eden Valley’s four-bed children’s unit was unable to meet the needs of these children and their families, but Ron’s research contributed to the creation of the Jigsaw Childrens’ hospice, which serves Cumbria and part of the Scottish Borders region. I also knew Ron as a keen follower of football and a dedicated supporter of Aston Villa.
