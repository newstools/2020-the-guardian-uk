Dr Anthony Matheson reports his difficulty volunteering to rejoin the NHS (Letters, 10 April). As a recently retired GP, I too wanted to volunteer. Very efficiently, I received an email from the General Medical Council asking if I’d re-register, and then an email from the NHS thanking me for applying and saying I’d hear from my regional team within three days. Ten days later, having heard nothing, I found nhsprofessionals.nhs.uk, which is processing my application. I urge other would-be volunteers to try this route.Dr Peter SpargoColwall, Herefordshire • At 82, I have been reading the Guardian for over 60 years. There have been many notable, indeed historic, front pages, but Saturday’s (The lives cut short, 11 April) stands with the best. Thank you.Dennis RustonAshby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire • As seasoned hot cross bun makers, we’d love the saffron buns featured alongside your report (Online cookery boom caters to taste for something different, 10 April), so it seems rather cruel to print the recipe at a time when there is a countrywide dearth of suitable flour and no yeast at all to be had.Judith KentBarnet, London • Zoe Williams says she’s still having an Easter egg hunt despite the children being too old and the house too hot (Opinion, 12 April). I’m still having an Easter egg despite being 56, living alone with a cat, and the house being average temperature.Angela CrabtreeBracknell, Berkshire • As a stickler for tradition, I shall be spending part of bank holiday Monday sitting in my car on the drive, pretending I’m in a traffic jam. If it rains, so much the better.Kevin RushfirthOtley, West Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
