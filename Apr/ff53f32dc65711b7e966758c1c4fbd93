The obituary of Charles Wood mentioned his military career and how this seems to have influenced much of his subsequent work for stage and screen. This interest may have been nurtured at King Charles I school, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, where he joined the newly formed contingent of the Combined Cadet Force under Captain Gordon Potter. Charles became one of the first sergeants of the contingent, indicating his interest and ability. Three decades later, when Charles went to the dinner to mark Gordon’s retirement with the rank of major, he shared with us what Gordon meant to him. Despite Charles’s fame as a leading playwright, he was happy to pay his respects to the man who first encouraged his interest in what appears to have been an important part of the warp and weft of his life’s work.
