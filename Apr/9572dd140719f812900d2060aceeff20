In Thailand the Songkran festival was cancelled nationwide to combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The water festival is normally held every year to celebrate the traditional Thai New Year on 13 April, when people splash water on each other and sprinkle powder on their faces as a symbolic sign of cleansing and washing away the sins of the past year.
