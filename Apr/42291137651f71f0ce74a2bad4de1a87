Nextis to begin selling online again on Tuesday after putting extra safety measures in place to ensure warehouse staff can work safely. The UK’s second-biggest clothing retailer closed its online operations in late March because of the coronavirus crisis. But a statement posted on the Next website said warehouse managers had “successfully tested opening and taking a limited number of orders today” and invited customers to shop online again from 14 April. Bosses said they have spent two weeks “reworking” warehouse operations and have taken “lots of practical measures” to ensure that staff who want to work “feel safe, work safe and are safe”. “In order to operate our warehouse safely, we are limiting the number of warehouse colleagues working at any time, and so we will limit the number of customer orders we can take each day,” said the statement. “We have put extra safety measures in our warehouse to ensure our colleagues can work safely for you.” Next has posted a video on the website explaining safety measures put in place for warehouse staff. These safety measures include: two-metre floor markings to help staff maintain physical distancing; a one-way movement system; and sanitising stations. Staff will also wear tabards marked on the back with the message, “stay 2 metres apart” and will be given “keep clean kits”.
