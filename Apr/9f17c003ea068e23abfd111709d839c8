Denmark moved into lockdown a couple of weeks before the UK and is now enjoying the benefits of its swift reaction to the coronavirus crisis. The country has announced that it will reopen hairdressing salons on Monday – a full week before its courts – giving Danes a chance to have a proper haircut. As soon as the news broke, the country’s biggest online haircut booking system crashed. The rest of us, however, are not so lucky. With the UK now into its fourth week of lockdown, people are reaching for the scissors – with mixed results. Have you been brave enough to cut your own hair? Has someone else been brave enough to let you cut theirs? Did it go to plan or have you been banned from the scissors? We want to hear your experiences and stories.
