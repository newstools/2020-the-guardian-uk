Since Sunday evening, when Scott Morrison announced strict new social distancing measures and a limit to public gatherings to two people, state and territories around Australia have introduced their own rules, fines and even jail sentences to deal with people breaking the rules. Some of the rules are unclear and the different penalties for each state and territory makes some of the new infringements confusing. While police commissioners have said they will use discretion in issuing fines, there are reports of people being stopped by police for undertaking activities – such as buying takeaway coffee – that appear to be allowed. We’d like to hear from people about their experiences dealing with police on the new social distancing measures in all states and territories. Have you been stopped by officers or had any interaction with police while going about your day since the new rules were introduced?
