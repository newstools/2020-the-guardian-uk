I first met Keith Lowe - the chocolatier behind Me Chocolate - some years ago. He was (still is) UK marketing manager and agent for Zotter chocolate. I’d just discovered Zotter’s Plum Brandy hand-scooped bar, which still holds a special place in my heart. So we had lots to talk about. Then, earlier this year, Keith, a member of the Academy of Chocolate and a judge in its annual awards, launched his own chocolate brand – Me Chocolate. The name doesn’t do much for me (ha ha), but the chocolate certainly does. Two big pluses, even before we get to the product, is that it comes in a big slab with no demarcations. So when you break some off, well it’s not your fault if it comes off in a huge chunk is it? And the wrapping is perfectly simple: brown paper, no fuss. The name doesn’t do much for me (ha ha), but the chocolate certainly does Then there’s the chocolate. There are currently 10 products in the range, all at £4.20, lots of darker milks, usually at 40.5% cocoa, with some white and one at 72%. I was disappointed that sugar was the first ingredient instead of cocoa, but that aside, this is really good chocolate. I didn’t like the white chocolate - too sweet – and the milk chocolate with lemon and sea salt really didn’t work for me. But the walnut and coffee was insanely good: light on the coffee, heavy on the walnuts. The dark/milk house blend (at 56.5% cocoa this is the highest cocoa content of all the milks) is worthy of note. But the real star in this range is the milk chocolate with roasted cocoa nibs: everything comes together perfectly in this bar, I predict it will become a best seller.
