A Tulane University basketball player who recently declared for the NBA draft has been charged with murder and other counts in a Georgia homicide. Teshaun Hightower, who led the Green Wave in scoring last season, was booked into jail on Saturday on multiple charges, including murder and aggravated assault. He was one of six people wanted in connection with an 8 April homicide in Stockbridge, Georgia, Henry County police said. A police spokesman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the victim, Devante Anthony Long, died from gunshot wounds after he was taken to a hospital. God protect my people 🙏🏾 Five of the six men are now in police custody, including Hightower’s brother, Jeffrey. On the day of the shooting, Teshaun Hightower posted a tweet that said “God protect my people.” On Monday, Teshaun Hightower’s attorney, Averick Walker, said Jeffrey had pulled the trigger but it was a case of self defense. “He’s innocent. He didn’t shoot anybody,” said Walker. “It’s sad that this detective sought to make him out to be a monster and he’s not. When it’s all said and done, it will come out in the wash that the person who did fire the gun shot the gun to protect Teshaun. “Teshaun’s brother actually fired the weapon and fired in self-defense. The victim came out of the house with a gun in his hand and turned his weapon toward Teshaun to shoot him. That’s why the victim was shot himself.” Tulane “immediately dismissed” Hightower from the basketball program after learning about his arrest. Hightower, 22, said he was entering the NBA draft pool on 18 April, just 10 days after Long’s death. In his announcement on Twitter, the guard noted he planned to maintain the option of returning to school with a year of eligibility left. Hightower, of Lithonia, Georgia, averaged 15.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game during the 2019-20 season, his only one at Tulane. He played the previous two seasons at Georgia before transferring.
