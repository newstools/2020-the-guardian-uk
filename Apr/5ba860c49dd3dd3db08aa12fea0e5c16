Livestreaming from the homes of bands and DJs around the UK, DIY magazine is hosting a virtual festival from Friday to Sunday (2pm-10pm BST). It follows on from popular streaming project, DIYsolation (which continues Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays), and has been organised in aid of the Help Musicians charity, with a call for donations to support acts affected by the numerous live events being postponed and cancelled. Live sets and activities will come from over 20 artists performing from their homes, including Pale Waves, Marika Hackman, Metronomyâ€™s Anna Prior, Sports Team, and thereâ€™s a pub quiz with Peace. Other highlights include the sassy Self Esteem (AKA Rebecca Lucy Taylor, formerly of Slow Club), 90s Club Kid vibes from Lynks Afrikka, and punk rockers Creeper reading spooky bedtime stories. Tinnies and glitter optional. The third virtual festival for Defected Records takes place on Friday night, after two hugely popular events last month â€“ one streamed from Ministry of Sound in London, the other from the homes of DJs. The bill for this Good Friday edition includes headliner Calvin Harris playing as his house and techno alias Love Regenerator, Roger Sanchez, Black Motion, Sam Divine and The Mambo Brothers with an Ibiza sunset-inspired set. The event calls on the audience to donate to the World Health Organisationâ€™s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, and will stream across Defectedâ€™s Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter from 2pm-10pm BST.
