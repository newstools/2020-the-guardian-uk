I am surely not alone in hoping to get Covid-19 in order to be granted the immunity to return to the world and lend a hand. This is not hubris – I am fit and healthy and for years have followed a sensible physical regime and for me, though I grant this is a gamble, the virus is unlikely to be mortal. I am no Dominic Cummings fan, but with his famously off-the-wall thinking, he might consider a controlled policy of volunteers, such as myself, to be exposed to the virus under strict conditions so as not to spread, self-isolate during its onset and then be in a unique position to offer up ourselves for research, to provide antibodies, to ameliorate the disease and, finally, join those valiantly fighting to help. As a former psychotherapist who worked in the NHS, and especially with those with a mortal condition or whose loved ones had sadly died, I feel my services would currently be more worthwhile both to myself and others in that capacity than just dallying at home not getting on with writing my next novel.Salley VickersWilcot, Wiltshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
