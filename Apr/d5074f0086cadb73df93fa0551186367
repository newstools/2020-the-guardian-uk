Your obituary of Ronan O’Rahilly, founder of Radio Caroline (23 April), took me back to the golden years of pirate radio. I was a pupil at Scarborough High School for Boys, and Radio 270 was broadcasting a few miles offshore. By a communications quirk, it was possible to hear the music being broadcast in one or two of the cubicles in the language “lab” we used once a week. Our French teacher couldn’t understand our enthusiasm to get to that lesson so eagerly in order to settle in to the best location for good reception!Ian FergusonPickering, North Yorkshire • “Silver bullets to public health has deadly consequences” (Editorial, 23 April). They do, but they’re traditionally shot at werewolves. I think you mean “magic bullets”, which may be somewhat less lethal, unless prescribed by Donald Trump.Tom MortonRedditch, Worcestershire • It is telling that one of the first actions of Boris Johnson after his recovery was to phone President Trump (What the EU procurement furore tells us about Johnson’s real priorities, 22 April) – one failed leader appeals to another.Philip StewartOxford • As a 17-year-old I had to fib about my age to gain access to pubs. Now, if the lockdown for the over-70s is extended (Report, 23 April), I may have to do the same again.Colin BurkeCartmel, Cumbria • I was wary of watching the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney’s Normal People as I loved the book. The peerless Lucy Mangan, with her utterly beautiful account, has persuaded me to give it a go (Normal People review – Sally Rooney’s love story is a small-screen triumph, 26 April).Deirdre BurrellMortimer, Berkshire
