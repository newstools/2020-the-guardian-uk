Liverpool players and staff will observe a minute’s silence on Wednesday to mark the 31st anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. The final memorial service scheduled to be held at Anfield in respect of the 96 Liverpool supporters who were unlawfully killed at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. But the anniversary will be commemorated in other ways, with families holding their own private services and “96” signs appearing in windows around the city. Flags at Anfield will be flown at half-mast throughout the day and Liverpool’s staff, including players who are at home as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, will hold a minute’s silence at 3.06pm, the time when the semi-final against Nottingham Forest was stopped. Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said of the memorial service postponement: “On behalf of the HFSG, I would like to thank everyone for their understanding in this matter. We hope to provide an update in the near future on a rescheduled date for the service. “I would also ask that you join us in our prayers on 15 April to remember the 96 and keep the families and everyone who has been affected in your thoughts at this difficult time.”
