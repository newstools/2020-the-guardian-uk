We’d like to hear from international students who are stranded in universities across the UK due to the coronavirus crisis. As lockdown measures were announced on 23 March, thousands of students from around the world who couldn’t book flights home found themselves stuck in the UK for the foreseeable future. We’d like to know what life is like for international students in the UK right now. Are you on lockdown alone or are you isolating with other students? Have you received support from your university? Are you still trying to travel home? You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists will be in contact for publication before we publish, so please do leave contact details. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here.
