Thank you for the picture of the goats strolling through Llandudno (31 March), apparently window shopping, keeping well apart, and giving a wide berth to the sheep’s wool shop. It might have been captioned “Coronavirus News: Clear Priorities”. Which is an anagram of “Our Capricorn visitors ’ere in Wales”.Fr Alec MitchellHolyhead, Anglesey • Re mountain goats at large in Llandudno, I once witnessed an even more bizarre sight in south Wales in the late 1960s. Visiting Treherbert on a busy Saturday afternoon, I was astonished to see sheep strolling in and out of Woolworths. Equally surprising was the attitude of the shoppers who seemed to regard it as an unremarkable though inconvenient occurrence.Peter BettsLiverpool • I see that Llandudno, which used to be a ghost town, has become a goats’ town.Paul MilehamBuckingham • Which is now the more useful PPE? Philosophy, politics and economics (the degree of choice for many aspiring politicians), or personal protective equipment?Stan LabovitchWindsor, Berkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
