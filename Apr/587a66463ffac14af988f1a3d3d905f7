Welcome back to the second of our weekly Spooks watch alongs. Let’s emphasise straight away that some people might be seeing BBC1’s banging 2002 counter-terrorism drama for the first time, so no spoilers. But yes, it’s series one, episode two. It’s THAT episode. Last time, despite it only being week one there was already a good gang of like-minded Spooks fans, reminiscing about watching the show back in the day as well as finding new things to enjoy. Clever people, watching telly together – or an “intelligence community”, if you will. Unfortunately Sarah Hughes is unwell so can’t make it tonight (she should be back with you next week). But with luck we will once again be joined by David Wolstencroft, who as well as creating the show was directly responsible for unleashing this instalment on an innocent, unsuspecting public. While you wait, why not refresh your mind about episode one with some great behind the scenes tidbits from David. Get ready to hit play on the episode at 7pm UK time precisely. • Get ready to hit play at 7pm BST (on BBC iPlayer in the UK, and Britbox in the US, where the show is called MI-5)
