This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are from the Wellington Collection, Apsley House, which was the home of Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington and the hero of Waterloo. The outstanding fine and decorative art on view reflect his taste and times, and celebrate Wellington as a heroic national figure. The house, at Hyde Park Corner, was built in the 1770s by Robert Adam but extensively remodelled in the 1820s by Benjamin Dean Wyatt.
