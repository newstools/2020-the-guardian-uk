The root of the dandelion (Letters, 8 April) was highly valued as a substitute for coffee during the war. Only those plants that had flourished all summer were used, as they had more goodness. The roots went deep and were carefully dug up, scrubbed clean and dried overnight in a low oven. Stored in an old biscuit tin until wanted, they were then roasted in a hot oven and ground up for coffee. They were too bitter for us kids who drank “milk and a dash” (of tea). We fed our rabbits on the leaves that were too tough to eat. There were 75 in all: kept in cages in our back yard. One of my jobs after school was to search for rabbit food in the field at the back. (However, I could never eat them.) Also, warts were painted with dandelion juice.Pat LambertKenilworth, Warwickshire • Though we wage war on dandelions in the garden, we have an abundant crop of lamb’s lettuce – a delicious addition to a salad.Rosemary RossHarpenden, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
