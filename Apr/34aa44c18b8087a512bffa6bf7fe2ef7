The catwalks of spring/summer 2020 might now feel like a distant memory, but tie-dye, which was spotted from New York to Milan this year, still has a place in our lives under lockdown. We asked Fyodor Golan, a London-based brand whose SS20 Good Luck Trolls collection featured psychedelic tie-dye prints, to give us a masterclass. “We are true believers in the power of colour,” say the partners behind the brand, Fyodor Podgorny and Golan Frydman. “We believe it is empowering and can lift you up.” To try this at home, you will need: fabric dye and fixer, old plastic bottles, elastic bands, plastic bags and garments to dye (cotton and natural-fabric garments will dye better). Golan recommends experimenting with old T-shirts, the paler and plainer the better. Or try a jacket or a simple pair of socks.
