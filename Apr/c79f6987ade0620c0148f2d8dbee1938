This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UKâ€™s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are from Pallant House Gallery in West Sussex. Located in the heart of Chichester on the south coast, Pallant House is a unique combination of a Grade I-listed, Queen Anne townhouse and an award-winning contemporary extension. Winner of the 2007 Gulbenkian prize for museums and galleries, Pallant House Gallery has one of the most significant collections of modern British art in Britain.
