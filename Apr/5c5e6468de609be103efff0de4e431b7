Israel’s opposition leader, Benny Gantz, has failed to form a coalition government after talks with Benjamin Netanyahu stalled, pushing the country further towards an unprecedented fourth round of elections. Gantz had until midnight on Wednesday to build a majority government and now loses the mandate given to him by the president, Reuven Rivlin. His failure does not automatically trigger fresh elections. Before that occurs, there will be a 21-day period in which the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, can vote to nominate any candidate to be prime minister. Netanyahu and Gantz may continue negotiations to join forces during that time, as together they could probably muster enough votes for a coalition. The pair have been discussing power-sharing options in which they would take it in turns to be prime minister over a four-year term. It will not be easy to reach a deal. During the past year, the two rivals have battled through three inconclusive national votes. In that time, they have also made multiple failed attempts to forge a unity government. Faced with the coronavirus pandemic, both have expressed a desire to come to an understanding. Rivlin agreed to extend a Monday deadline to Wednesday after it appeared as if progress had been made. The negotiating teams met again on Wednesday night but the deadline passed with neither side making any announcements. Israeli media have speculated that Netanyahu may prefer to hold an election after recent polling showed that he would win more seats. Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, has said publicly that he was working hard for a unity government.
