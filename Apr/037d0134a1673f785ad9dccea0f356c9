We’re six weeks into Drag Race and two weeks into lockdown – thank god for television, eh? Last week we saw Nicky Doll walk the plank, and were again left with the feeling that a contestant had left way too early, with more to offer ( Rock M Sakura – we love you). RuPaul is certainly making some interesting decisions this year. Maybe she’s just had enough. Maybe she’s trolling us all. We shall see. As episode 6 opens, Heidi pads into the workroom holding her shoes and rolling her eyes. She has the vibe of someone’s aunt who’s just been told by airport staff that they can’t find her luggage, and we’re here for it. Thank god she’s still here. Brita says “I don’t know why I was in the bottom.” Really? Aiden says “quiet Aiden isn’t going to be quiet for much longer.” OoOooh! Expression shots! Dramatic camera zooms! Rattlesnack shade noise! Cut to opening theme song! This week it’s the fan fave (and undisputably best) yearly maxichallenge, The Snatch Game. No minichallenge, for the second week running. We can see why. In years past, many of the minichallenges seemed a bit forced and pointless. Aiden is doing Patricia Quinn, the actor who played a Magenta in Rocky Horror and basically nothing else. Picking a cult indie actor no-one’s heard of, for a challenge where referential humour is tantamount, is so Aiden and so, so annoying. Fun fact; we’ve just been on Patricia Quinn’s Wikipedia page and she also played the role of “second girl at dance” in a film called Adolf Hitler: My Part In His Downfall AND she played someone called Susan White in an episode of The Bill. She is Northern Irish but somehow we doubt Aiden will be doing a British accent. RuPaul enters the workroom accompanied by ex-contestant and catchphrase queen Miss Vanjie! She made her own name a catchphrasejust by walking backwards down the catwalk and saying “Miss VAAAANJIE” multiple times. It spawned a stream of merch, earned her several contracts with big brands, and got her cast in multiple music videos. Pop culture is weird. Vanjie asks Heidi how she’s doing and she says she’s “doing blessed and highly favoured”… Oooo, kay. Jan’s doing musical theatre legend Bernadette Peters – this could be great. We also get a quick and interesting insight into the audition process for the show, when we see a brief shot of Jan’s audition clip, in which she impersonates Kris Jenner. We’ve heard from our sources (drag queens on Facebook) that even just making the audition tape is GRUELLING. It requires multiple tasks and skillsets and, allegedly, you’re not allowed to cut or edit it. It has to be done in one take. Blimey. Crystal Methyd is doing cult pop sensation Poppy! She’s great, and her music’s really fun and inventive, take a look if you haven’t already. Needless to say, Ru and Vanjie haven’t heard of her because her music’s actually original and legitimate and wasn’t produced by Lucian Piane. OOoooh, cue shady rattlesnake noise! As much as we love Poppy, we can’t see how she’ll work and be funny for Snatch Game. This could be curtains for Crystal. RuPaul’s being uncharacteristically human on this walkaround, dispensing sound advice and even hugs. Gigi’s got the genius idea of doing Sophia The Robot and firmly sticks to her guns when RuPaul basically advises her not to do it. Good for you, Gigi. Here we go, it’s Snatch Game! The two celebs taking part, and this week’s judges are Mean Girls alumni Daniel Franzese (Damian “too gay to function” Leigh) and Jonathan Bennett (Aaron “your hair looks sexy pushed back” Samuels). Heidi isn’t really acting or looking anything like Leslie Jones but she’s hilarious just because it’s her. Jaida’s Cardi B is pretty good. Jan and Widow are great as Bernadette and Tina Turner as well. This is a STRONG Snatch Game. Ru says to Gigi as Sophia “I wonder if you can receive a big black cock?” Err ... whatever happened to double entendre? Gigi’s stunning, with some fab physical comedy and full of high tech puns, despite Ru’s weird questioning. Aiden is not doing a Northern Irish accent and the jokes (if they can even be called that) are not landing. snatch game but it's just gigi goode @thegigigoode #dragrace pic.twitter.com/2jqx9JBNr7 The beauty team have REALLY stepped it up this year, Ru and Michelle look more flawless every week. Ru’s metallic shimmer sensation is gorgeous and Michelle’s dress is beautiful. We cannot say the same for Daniel Franzese’s shirt ... thing [Ed: you are so, soooo wrong]. He’s aged very well since Mean Girls though. Hi Daniel. This week’s runway category is Frozen Eleganza (how much doooolar did Ru get from Disney for that?). Heidi, head-to-toe in white fur, says she’s serving “High Empress to the yeti folk.” That’s possibly our favourite runway voiceover quote from anyone ever. The platinum blonde hair really works on her. “I CAN DO CONCEPTUAL LOOKS! I’M NOT AFRAID TO GO TO THOSE PLACES!” says Jan. Sure, Jan. Although, the look, while clever, isn’t our favourite. Gigi’s cute ice-cream girl wins, and deservedly so. why 👏 are 👏 the 👏 judges 👏 sleeping 👏 on 👏jan👏 #dragrace pic.twitter.com/FbapK1RjjR It took six weeks, but finally the two people who most need to be in the bottom two, are in the bottom two – Aiden and Brita. The song is OBVIOUSLY Let It Go. Side bar: there’s a special place in hell for the loud people in gay bars who scream along to this song (there’s also a special place in hell for gay bars that play this song). It suddenly starts snowing and Brita does some breathtaking witchery with a sort of flashing hand trick explosion thing. Bye Aiden. 6. Let it go - Aiden Zhane vs Brita. pic.twitter.com/eI5wnAvLZX Shadiest moment Aiden’s complete lack of acknowledgement that her character was Northern Irish. Catchphrase watch “Blessed and highly favoured” Animal print hunt Timid and tame this week at two garments, with just Crystal’s usual leopardpint shirt and leopardprint neckerchief in her interview clips. Unless we count Heidi’s yeti ... print? No, white fur is not a print. Just between us snowfriends A much better episode this week - it took a while but this season is finally picking up the pace. Some genuine laughs, and a collection of wow and WTF moments. What more can you ask for from Drag Race? • This article was corrected on 6 April as Patricia Quinn does not have a Northern Irish accent.
