The Archers will broadcast three weeks of themed episodes from the archives in May because of delays in recording new episodes due to the coronavirus crisis, BBC Radio 4 has said. There will be five archive episodes each week from 3 May to 24 May, with new episodes planned from 25 May onwards. The cast are recording new episodes in their homes, which are being written and produced in a different format, and the process is taking longer than was originally anticipated. Jeremy Howe, the programme’s editor, said: “We know our listeners tune in to The Archers for many different reasons, not simply entertainment but escapism and companionship too. “We’re working tirelessly in challenging circumstances on writing and producing new episodes in a different, simpler format with cast recording in their homes, but with that work taking a little longer than anticipated, we want listeners to be able to continue visiting Ambridge. “The Archers is steeped in rich heritage and many listeners have said they’re keen to hear again, or hear for the first time, important moments in the lives of Ambridge residents, so we’re selecting episodes from the last two decades we hope will give the audience new insight or an enjoyable trip down memory lane.” The first week of archive episodes will include four weddings and a funeral, when some favourite characters walk down the aisle, and Ambridge bids farewell to one treasured resident. The episodes in the second week focus on prominent storylines for a number of characters, in particular in relation to the homes and farms that mean so much to them. In the third week, the show will revisit significant annual traditions in the Ambridge calendar, such as Stir Up Sunday and the annual flower and produce show. The move comes amid fears TV channels could run out of shows, with popular soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street cutting the number of episodes screened to try to avoid running out of pre-filmed material.
