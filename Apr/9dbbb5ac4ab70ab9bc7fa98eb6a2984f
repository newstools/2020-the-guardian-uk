Similar to the fact that not everyone suffers equally in a recession, it is just as true that some people’s wellbeing may improve during the coronavirus pandemic. As Farrah Jarral sets out (The lockdown paradox: why some people’s anxiety is improving during the crisis, 29 April), this will be largely defined by people’s circumstances, and it is hard to imagine that such an uplift will apply to those in economically insecure positions, or those responding to the crisis from the frontlines. However, much as any improvement in wellbeing should not be treated as universal, wellbeing should not be conflated with mental illness. Preliminary results from our survey of more than 800 people living with mental illness, many of them severely affected and living with diagnoses such as psychosis or borderline personality disorder, reveal that 80% felt their mental health was worse due to the impact of the coronavirus, with 28% indicating that it was much worse. While necessary to prevent the spread of this highly contagious virus, lockdown is depriving people of the things that they need to stay well, from peer support groups to the routine of work and social engagements. We’re hearing from people who are not just feeling a lack of motivation or purpose but experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts, or a deterioration in their health to the point they require urgent intervention to manage paranoid delusions or psychosis. We are all responding to this crisis differently, but we must acknowledge the impact of this pandemic on people severely affected by mental illness so we are not faced with a hidden epidemic. We may be in crisis mode at the moment, but mental health must be a priority in the response to the coronavirus, which is why sustained investment in mental health services is crucial.Danielle HammAssociate director of campaigns and policy, Rethink Mental Illness • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
