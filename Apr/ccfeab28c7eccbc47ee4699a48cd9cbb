Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. Five weeks into lockdown and our two 10-year-olds are badgering us to buy some new electronic games. They want a Nintendo Switch but I am reluctant to pay the £200-plus it costs. What’s kept your kids amused in recent weeks? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
