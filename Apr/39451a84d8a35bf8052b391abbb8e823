Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. I’m in the fortunate position of keeping my (well-paid) job so far during the coronavirus outbreak; now I’m working from home and spending almost nothing. I want to donate to help people hit by the crisis, but how? Give cash to the local hospital? A food bank? What’s a good cause for helping victims? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
