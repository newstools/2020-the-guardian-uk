Super League clubs will notify their players of proposals to cut salaries across the competition over the coming days, with a warning that the reductions may last for the entirety of this year. Rugby league is waiting on a decision from the government regarding emergency funding, with a decision expected in the near future. However, it is believed more needs to be done within the game to ensure the sport and its clubs make the necessary financial adjustments to survive, irrespective of that decision by Westminster.The Guardian has learned that all 12 top-flight clubs are putting together pay-cut proposals which are expected to be sent to players by the end of this week. With the prospect of the season remaining on hiatus for a prolonged period, it has left many clubs without income from gate receipts and sponsorship that, for some, is required to stay afloat. Super League has not sent out a competition-wide proposal for pay cuts but clubs have instead formed their own packages based on their individual financial projections. It is believed that at a recent meeting clubs agreed to all try to work within a 10% of one another.Clubs are taking such a long-term approach not only due to the immediate cashflow issue the sport faces, but also the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic if and when the season eventually restarts. “With the economy likely to be struggling for a long time, and huge unemployment expected in northern, working-class areas – which is effectively our support base – the idea of people forking out for two games a week is fanciful,” one Super League executive said.That has led clubs to determine that any pay cuts implemented – which will begin immediately, with the players’ April salaries being reduced – will have to be in place for at least the whole of the current contract year, which runs until the end of November. The feeling within many boardrooms is that it could take years for rugby league to return to the financial footing it was on before the crisis began.There have even been calls from some clubs about a discussion over lowering the salary cap to secure the long-term future of the game, though it is understood that seems unlikely at this stage. The Guardian also understands that clubs have collectively agreed to take a stand of solidarity against any player who tries to launch legal proceedings as a result of the cuts, effectively agreeing not to sign the player should they become a free agent in the future.
