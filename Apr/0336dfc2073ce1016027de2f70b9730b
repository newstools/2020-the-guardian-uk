Papua New Guinea’s prime minister has been tested for Covid-19 after he was exposed to the virus by a customs agent. James Marape is among a number of officials leading the country’s response to coronavirus who was tested. Their samples have been flown to the Australian city of Brisbane, with results expected by Friday afternoon. The National Operations Centre, which is the country’s nerve centre for the fight against the spread of the virus, is under lockdown and surrounded by security. Staff have been instructed to self isolate at home. The functions of NOC have been moved to an alternative location. On Friday the state of emergency controller, David Manning, issued new emergency directives to contain the virus. They include: an 8pm-6am curfew, a ban on all public gatherings and public transport, and an outright liquor ban. The new orders cover the nation’s capital, Port Morseby and two neighbouring provinces, Central and Western. Western province, which shares the border with Indonesia, has recorded three cases among the traditional border crossers. In Port Moresby, Manning has declared business as usual for the joint task force at the alternative command centre but there is fear and anxiety among officers. There is a long list of people, including PNG journalists, who were exposed at the command centre where the PM was giving daily updates on Covid-19. Manning said anyone who visited the command centre in the past seven days should present themselves for testing. Both the police minister and the health minister, who are regulars at the command centre, are said to be among the list of people exposed. The measures come after an employee of PNG’s National Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Authority tested positive. The employee visited the command centre daily to provide briefings to the joint task force team. Five new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in PNG, bringing the total to seven since the first case was detected.
