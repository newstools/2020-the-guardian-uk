Elizabeth Warren has said she would accept an offer to be running mate to the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, if the position were offered. “Yes,” said the US Senator when asked on MSNBC how she would respond if Biden asked her to run for vice-president. Biden, who was Barack Obama’s vice-president, has vowed to pick a woman to be his running mate and said he would name a committee to help him vet a shortlist of names soon. Warren endorsed Biden earlier on Wednesday. She ended her own bid for the White House in March and became known for championing detailed and sweeping liberal reforms. Biden has been working to win the support of more liberal parts of the party ahead of his battle against Donald Trump in the 3 November election. A spokesman for the Biden campaign declined to comment on Warren’s remarks. Several people likely to be in contention have expressed their interest. “I would be an excellent running mate,” said Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, in an interview published by Elle on Wednesday. Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan told NBC News on Wednesday that she was “fortunate” to be considered for the position.
