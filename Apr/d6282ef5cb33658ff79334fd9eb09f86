The Premier League season must be scrapped and declared null and void if it cannot be restarted, Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has said. The Premier League confirmed last week that the season, originally suspended until 30 April, will not resume at the beginning of May and will return only when the situation stabilises. Liverpool needed six points to seal the title while European places and relegation candidates were still unclear with nine games to go, raising questions about how they will be decided if the season does not resume. “Scrap it and start again. Start it again,” Shaw said during the Combat Corona fundraiser for Unicef, a Fifa 20 competition streamed on Twitch. “It’s got to be. If we can’t carry it on, it’s got to be void.” Shaw was part of the event that also included Gareth Bale, Paulo Dybala, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jordan Pickford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. It raised around £17,000 through online donations. Some Premier League clubs had mulled finishing the season by playing games without spectators but Shaw said that was not a view he endorsed. “Fans are so important. You realise it even more [now],” he said. “The sport is for fans really … if you don’t have fans, and you don’t play in front of fans, it just doesn’t feel right. Especially on matchday the fans are always amazing and always help the team. Whether it’s home or even away our fans are always brilliant and I feel like they’re always there with us.” United were three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea when the season was suspended.
