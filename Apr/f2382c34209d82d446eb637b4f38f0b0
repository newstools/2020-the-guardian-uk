Savings rates are being slashed, with some high street accounts now paying as little as 0.01% interest. But experts said consumers “do not have to take this lying down,” and urged them to switch to one of the accounts still offering a semi-decent rate. The financial information firm Moneyfacts said savings deals were being “pulled left, right and centre” as banks and building societies reacted to the emergency measures to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Providers have been cutting already low rates. For example, NatWest’s instant-access primary savings account currently pays between 0.1% and 0.25% depending on the balance. From 8 June this will plummet to a flat 0.01%. Best-buy accounts have also had a rates cut: on 17 April, the online provider Marcus, a division of Goldman Sachs, said it was trimming its savings account rate from 1.3% to 1.2%. However, that is still a top rate for an easy-access account. Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: “If savers are hoping to secure an attractive rate, then applying quickly has never been so crucial. Savers must also review any accounts they currently have and switch if they are on a poor rate.” Vanquis Bank is paying 1.6% on its one-year fixed-rate account, while RCI Bank is paying 1.9% on its five-year fixed-rate product, according to Anna Bowes, the co-founder of the Savings Champion website. At the time of writing, the best savings rate available was with United Bank UK (UBL), whose seven-year fixed-term deposit account pays 1.95%. However, this involves tying up your money for almost a decade, and the minimum deposit is £2,000. Someone putting away this sum would, at the end of the term, have a balance of £2,289. There was some good news a few days ago, when National Savings &and Investments said it was cancelling planned rate cuts on a range of its accounts and would delay plans to make its premium bonds prize fund less generous.
