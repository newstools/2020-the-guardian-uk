The Fiji Rugby Union has criticised two of its players who have been arrested for failing to self-isolate after returning to Fiji from overseas, including Semi Kunatani of Harlequins. Media in Fiji named one of the players as the back-rower Kunatani, who was a member of the Fiji sevens team that won a gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The other player has not yet been named. Both players returned to Fiji via Singapore. They were arrested for failing to observe a 14-day quarantine designed the prevent the spread of Covid-19. Fiji has reported 12 cases. “We strongly condemn the behaviour of these two players and their disregard for lawful instructions to self-isolate themselves,” said John O’Connor, chief executive of Fiji rugby. “Such irresponsible behaviour is totally unacceptable and we support the actions of the police in arresting these two players and any further action taken against them. Fiji Rugby will take appropriate disciplinary actions against the professional rugby players, including reporting this highly irresponsible behaviour to their clubs and World Rugby.” The Fiji prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, highlighted the case of the players during his regular news briefing on Sunday.
