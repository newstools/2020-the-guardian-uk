A shipment of personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey has arrived in the UK after the government was criticised for ignoring offers from British suppliers. If you are an individual, group or supplier making gowns, masks and other items we would like to hear from you. Who is involved in production and how are the items made? Is the PPE intended for use in the UK or is it being sent abroad? We would also like to hear from those who offered their services to the government but were turned down.
