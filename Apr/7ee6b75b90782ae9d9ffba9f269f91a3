The michelada is Mexico’s answer to the bloody mary, and is just the thing for an Easter brunch. The spice mix isn’t really worth making in smaller quantities, but you’ll be wanting more than one, so that’s no great burden. Adjust the amount of hot sauce to suit your own tastes, if you like. Serves 1 For the bloody mary mix (makes 8 servings)50ml mushroom ketchup – we use Geo Watkins, which is widely available50ml Worcestershire sauce50ml hot sauce – we use Crystal Louisiana, but any American-style brand will do, such as Frank’s Red Hot, sold in supermarkets25ml horseradish sauce (not creamed)25ml wholegrain mustard For the drink (per serving)100ml craft-style lager, chilled (ours is brewed for us by Jeffersons Brewery in south-west London)150ml plain unsalted tomato juice, chilled – we use The Tomato Stall from the Isle of Wight25ml bloody mary mix (see above)Lemon juice and cajun spice mix, to rim the glass1 cherry tomato and 1 lemon wedge, to garnish In a jug or bowl, stir all the bloody mary mix ingredients until well combined, then pour into a sterilised jar and seal. To make the drink, pour the lager, tomato juice and 25ml of the bloody mary mix into a mixing glass – do not add ice – and stir. Dip the rim of a large highball glass first in lemon juice and then in cajun spice mix, to coat the outside edge, then fill the glass with ice. Pour in the contents of the mixing glass, garnish with a cherry tomato and a lemon wedge, and serve. Ivan Ramos, bar manager, Sam’s Riverside, London W6
