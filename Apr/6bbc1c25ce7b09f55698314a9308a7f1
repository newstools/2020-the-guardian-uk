Hello and welcome everyone to the beginning of the Spooks watch along with a fast-paced opening episode centred around American pro-life terrorists that introduces us to main gang including MI5 section D leader Tom Quinn (Mathew Macfadyen) and junior case officer Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes). David Wolstencroft, the creator of the show, is hopefully going to be joining us from Los Angeles to answer any burning questions you might have about the ideas behind the plots and characters, and, given that some people may be watching for the first time we’ll be following the standard all speculation and no spoilers policy below the line … • Get ready to hit play at 7pm BST (on BBC iPlayer in the UK, and Britbox in the US, where the show is called MI-5)
