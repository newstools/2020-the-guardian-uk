Recipient of the Queen’s gold medal for poetry in 2014, Imtiaz Dharker grew up in Glasgow and lived for many years in Mumbai before settling in London with her late husband Simon Powell, the creator of GCSE Poetry Live. Her work is full of a deep relish for all the world has to offer – food, travel, colour, love – and a lip-smacking relish for words themselves. I need sarson da saag,nothing else will satisfy me, and hot makki di rotiwith butter melting over it. I need to eat bacon and eggsand the petals off a rose, one by one. My greed has no nationality.I need my mother’s chicken salan. I want her to break the rotiscoop up the gravy and keep putting it in my mouthuntil my hunger’s done. I need to runout to my father’s land and sit in the old ganna fieldwhere I can hear the sugar growing, juice rushing up through the stemto reach my waiting mouth. I need to tear the outer skinand crunch the sugar-veins. I am hungry to be the womanwatching the young man bathing at the well,water running down his back, streaming down the lengthof his black, black hair. I need to crack walnuts with my teethand eat their brains. I need to take a trainto somewhere, and get off at platforms I don’t knowto drink sweet milky tea steaming in the early morningout of earthen hullers. I need to go to Crawford Marketthrough the piles of fruit and buy a whole sackof ripe mangoes to suck and sucktill nothing is left but dry seeds. I need you to come back. • From The Terrorist at my Table (Bloodaxe, 2006)
