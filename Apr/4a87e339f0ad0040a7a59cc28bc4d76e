I hope all the victims of this illness, including Boris Johnson, make a full recovery. But if they do it won’t be due to some steely inner quality of theirs, but because of a combination of luck and excellent medical care. I am tired of politicians and commentators telling us Boris Johnson is a “fighter”, “very determined” or “strong”, as if all those who have succumbed, including medical and care staff, were victims of some personal weakness or absence of determination.Isabella StoneSheffield • Dominic Raab says Boris Johnson will “pull through” his health crisis “because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter” (Boris Johnson to stay in hospital amid concerns over political vacuum, 7 April). This blather implies that anyone who does not “pull through” is not “a fighter”. Did he think of the effect of his words on anyone who has lost a loved one to coronavirus?Liam McAuleyBooterstown, Co Dublin, Ireland • A bit cruel to put a picture of Dominic Raab under a headline referring to a “political vacuum”.Louise MorreyBarlow, Derbyshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
