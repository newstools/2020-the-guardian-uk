I have never been much of a one for seed trays. I don’t have a greenhouse and only narrow windowsills. Plus, I am married to a minimalist architect who has a near-fear of ‘clutter’. Pretty much, the first early potatoes are the only ‘seed’ stuff I start at home. I prefer the slightly anxious scan along a row of string on soil as I wait to spot newly sprouted signs of life. Though, then, I am of course a bit loath to thin them out. The idea of Darwinist selection doesn’t sit well. It is probably why I’ll never be a proper gardener, this aversion to throwing the weakest baby away. Though I admire neat rows of properly spaced plants as much as the next person, I have come to the conclusion it just isn’t for me. These, though, are special circumstances. I’ve been concerned they’ll lock the allotments, as I hear other local authorities have done. So I have three trays of seedlings on the roof terrace as we speak: root trainers of assorted French beans and peas, courgettes and corn I hope to transplant on to the plot, plus a cheap tray scattered with radish that I pick through as if they’re spicy sweets. It’s not the same as getting earth under my nails, but in the new age of anxiety, I find peace in scanning for new shoots here, too. The terrace’s potted bulbs have been magnificent. Star of the show as I write has been the beautiful pheasant’s eye narcissus, it is my new old-school sweet-scented favourite. Maybe because they remind me of Mum. The tulips, too, are tall and will, we hope, be in flower for a long while. We have, of course, already forgotten the names of all the varieties, only that they were bought from Bloms. It’s only our second year of growing spring flower bulbs in pots at home and they bring us a special joy. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.
