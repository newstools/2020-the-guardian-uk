This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by National Museums Liverpool. National Museums Liverpool comprises eight museums and galleries, including some of the most visited in the UK, outside of London. The breadth of the collections is extraordinary, containing everything from impressionist paintings and rare beetles to a lifejacket from the Titanic. You can see art from National Museums Liverpool on Art UK here. Find out more on the National Museums Liverpool’s website here.
