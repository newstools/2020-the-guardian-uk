Some UK care homes have been very badly affected by Covid-19 and we’d like to hear from managers and workers about how they’re dealing with the situation. What are conditions like for staff and residents, how are you coping? We’d also like families to get in touch whose relatives are living in homes that are hardest hit by the virus. Are you managing to stay in contact with residents and what are your main concerns? If you’re a resident in a home, we’d like to hear from you too. You can get in contact with us by filling in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. One of our journalists will be in contact with you before we publish any contributions, so please do leave contact details. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
