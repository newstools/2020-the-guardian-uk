Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My husband keeps ordering online shopping (not just food), arguing that the firms will go bust if everyone stops. I worry that he and others are indirectly forcing courier drivers to keep on working unnecessarily. Has anyone else wrestled with this? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
