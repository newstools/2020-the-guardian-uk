The England women’s team have linked up with the #PlayersTogether initiative instigated by Premier League players and aimed at providing support to the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic. After discussing the best way to get involved in the campaign the squad will make a collective donation to the fund. A letter was tweeted by each of the Lionesses on Tuesday evening. The England captain, Steph Houghton, said : “After discussions with a number of Premier League players we are delighted to confirm the whole of the Lionesses squad will make a collective donation in order to support the amazing NHS.” The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, who played a leading part in establishing the fund, his teammate James Milner and the former England player Alex Scott applauded the move. Launched last week after the coming together of the 20 Premier League captains, the charitable fund has partnered directly with NHS Charities Together to provide financial support that “will help quickly grant funds to the frontline to support in a number of ways, including to help enhance the wellbeing of NHS staff, volunteers and patients impacted by Covid-19.” Its announcement came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, singled out Premier League footballers in a government briefing, calling on players to “take a pay cut and play their part” in efforts to support the health service. It was a statement which drew criticism from many, including players, with broadcaster Gary Lineker calling it “extraordinary how it was footballers that were targeted”. Henderson, Manchester United’s Harry Maguire, Watford’s Troy Deeney and West Ham’s Mark Noble are in charge of administering the fund on behalf of the players.
