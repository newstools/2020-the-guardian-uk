French toast is such a treat for a weekend breakfast, and I’ve found a way of making it even more decadent. Here, I’ve been inspired by the Australian lamington cake, tossing the just-fried toast in a coconut-sugar coating before serving it alongside sweetened cream and a raspberry compote. You’re welcome. Prep 20 minCook 25 minServes 4-6 6 slices thick cut bread2 large eggs160ml milk1 tsp vanilla extract bean paste½ tsp fine salt60g caster sugar45g unsalted butterFor the raspberry compote250g raspberries (fresh or frozen)2 tbsp caster sugar1 tbsp lemon juice3 tbsp water For the cream300ml double cream2 tbsp caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extractFor the coconut coating200g caster sugar200g desiccated coconut, toasted First, prepare the raspberry compote. Add all the ingredients to a saucepan and bring to a boil for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer gently for 10 minutes. Cool the mixture to thicken. Next, the cream. Whisk all the ingredients together to form soft peaks, then store in the fridge until ready to use. Now get started on the toast. Cut the crusts off the bread, then cut each piece of bread into six, equal rectangles, to emulate a slice of lamington cake. Whisk the eggs, milk, salt, vanilla and sugar in a medium sized bowl. In a separate bowl, make the coating, mixing the desiccated coconut and sugar together. Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat – be careful not to let it turn brown. Toss the bread pieces into the eggy mixture, then shake off the excess with your hands. Put the bread pieces in the frying pan and cook until golden brown on all sides. This should take two to three minutes. Remove the bread pieces from the frying pan, and toss straight into the coconut coating before plating up. Repeat with the rest of bread pieces. Serve with the cream and raspberry compote alongside.
