This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Dulwich Picture Gallery, the world’s first purpose-built public art gallery. Nestled in south-east London, the gallery’s building, designed by Sir John Soane, is set in beautiful grounds and features a fine collection of old master paintings by Rembrandt, Canaletto, Rubens and Gainsborough among others. Founded in the 19th century, today the gallery unites its past with the present through a programme of innovative exhibitions, revealing fresh perspectives and introducing overlooked and emerging artists with incredible stories.
