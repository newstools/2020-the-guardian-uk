Earlier today I set you three Double Choco puzzles. You can see a printable page of them here, or read my tutorial of how to solve them here. The solutions to these puzzles are here. I hope you enjoyed these puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. If you are reading this in the Guardian app, and you want a notification each time I post a puzzle, or its solution, click the ‘Follow Alex Bellos’ button above. Thanks to Tom Collyer, Liane Robinson and Rob Vollmert for today’s puzzles. To find out more about the UK Puzzle Association, its website is www.ukpuzzles.org.
