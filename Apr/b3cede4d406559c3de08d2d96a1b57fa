We’ve published a bunch of articles about how the coronavirus crisis has impacted the Australian arts industry. The damage was compounded this month when 49 organisations missed out on Australia Council funding – and compounded again last week, when the federal government denied changes to jobkeeper legislation that would make the benefits more accessible to casual workers and those on short-term contracts (AKA most arts and entertainment workers). But there are small things you can do. It’s an imperfect solution, as highlighted this week, but streaming Australian music can help. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 brand new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. “Australian music needs all the help it can get right now,” says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who’ve played Sound Australia’s events. “Streaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.”
