The musician Marianne Faithfull has been discharged from hospital 22 days after being admitted with coronavirus symptoms, and thanked NHS staff for “without a doubt” saving her life. A statement posted to Faithfull’s social media said the 73-year-old would continue to recuperate in London. She thanked fans for their support. No further details have been shared. We are really happy to say that Marianne has been discharged from hospital today, 22 days after being admitted suffering from the symptoms of Covid-19. She will continue to recuperate in London. Faithfull was admitted to hospital in early April after experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. She tested positive for the virus and later contracted pneumonia. At the time, her management said she was “stable and responding to treatment”. There were signs her condition was improving when she was announced as a participant in an ongoing daily online reading of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner, alongside such stars as Jeremy Irons and Tilda Swinton. JK Rowling shared the news of Faithfull’s recovery on Twitter with a string of tulip emoji. Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet tweeted: “Good to hear that Marianne Faithfull is out of hospital after three weeks. Get well soon Marianne!” In 2006, Faithfull was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent successful surgery. In 2007, she announced she had hepatitis C, diagnosed 12 years previously. She also has arthritis, and has had other joint issues, including a hip injury that became infected after surgery, forcing her to cancel a 2015 tour. Apart from a decade-long fallow period after her 1960s breakthrough, she has steadily released music throughout her life. Her most recent album was 2018’s Negative Capability, described as “a masterly meditation on ageing and death” in a five-star Observer review.
