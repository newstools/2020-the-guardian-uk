UK Athletics has finally handed over to the UK Anti-Doping Agency its full internal 2015 review into Mo Farah’s relationship with Alberto Salazar. The report, which is said to include detailed accounts of Farah’s training and medical data, came after repeated requests from Ukad to see it as well as an extraordinary rebuke from Ukad’s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, to UK Athletics last month. Previously, Ukad had seen only an edited Powerpoint executive summary of the 2015 report, which was led by three former athletes and concluded there were “no concerns” about Farah continuing with Salazar, despite a BBC Panorama programme raising questions about the American coach. Salazar, who guided Farah to Olympic gold over 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Games, was banned from the sport in 2019 after being found guilty of doping violations. However he is appealing against his ban. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Farah, who worked under Salazar between 2011 and 2017. A UK Athletics spokesperson confirmed the news and said the organisation “remains fully committed to protecting the integrity of the sport and the pursuit of clean athletics”, adding: “We will continue to assist Ukad with any further queries.” On Tuesday it was announced that Sarah Rowell, who led the UKA internal investigation, is to step down from the UK Athletics board a year earlier than planned.
