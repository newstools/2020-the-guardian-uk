On Saturday, Chris Maslanka converted my household to wearing masks in public with his solution to the first Pyrgic puzzle (18 April). His impeccable logic is too important to be tucked away where relatively few will read it. To summarise, any change in the infection rate of the virus is magnified greatly in the numbers infected. Thus every change for the better, such as people wearing masks, really matters. It matters little if all masks are not the best, or all wearers not skilled, because these are just minor percentages; the main thing is to block as much virus as we can. Whether an individual wearer is fully protected is beside the point. I would like to see the presenters at every coronavirus briefing walk in with masks on. The first speaker removes the mask, explains why they can (the empty room), and says their bit. Exeunt wearing masks. Perhaps lockdowns in defined non-hotspots can be lifted earlier on condition that masks be worn, and offenders be refused entry. Perhaps shops can offer free upgrades where the spirit is willing but the mask is weak. This is another case where we would respond better than the government gives us credit for.Malcolm FowlesCaversham, Reading • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
