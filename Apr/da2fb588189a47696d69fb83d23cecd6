This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Penlee House Gallery and Museum. Penlee House is the only Cornish public gallery specialising in the historic art of west Cornwall, including the Newlyn School artists (1880–1940). Set in an elegant Victorian house and park, it has built an international reputation for its year-round programme of exhibitions, which offer the unique opportunity of viewing works a stone’s throw from where they were created. You can see art from Penlee House Gallery and Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the Penlee House Gallery and Museum website here.
