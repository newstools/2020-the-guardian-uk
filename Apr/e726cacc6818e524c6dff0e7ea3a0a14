Lando Norris has invited Captain Tom Moore to visit McLaren’s headquarters in Woking once the lockdown is lifted as he congratulated the 99-year-old on his mammoth fundraising effort for the NHS. Moore, a veteran of the second world war, has raised over £27.5m for the NHS Charities Together and the fight against coronavirus by walking lengths of his garden – while he could now be on his way to the top of the music charts with a recording of You’ll Never Walk Alone with West End star Michael Ball. Moore is a long-time motorsport fan, and got a call from McLaren’s Norris over the weekend. “I want to say a big congratulations for what you’ve achieved,” Norris told Moore in a video of the call released by his family via Twitter. “I’m sure you’ve been told many times but … from my side and everyone and McLaren we want to say a big congratulations for what you’ve done. “It’s my honour that I get to speak to people like you, Captain Tom. You’ve achieved things that very few people get to achieve ever in their lifetime, especially at 99 years old and coming on to 100 - that’s another big achievement,” he said. “We would love to invite you, eventually, whenever you want to McLaren for a little tour - or a big tour - whatever you want, of our facility.” Moore told Norris he would look forward to visiting McLaren as soon as possible. “Nothing would give me more pleasure,” he said. “That would be phenomenal for me to come round McLaren because I’ve been a McLaren fan for a long time.” Moore, who originally set out with a fundraising target of £1,000, has pledged to keep on walking as long as the donations are coming in - something which shows little sign of slowing at present. “I shall keep on walking while they keep on contributing,” he said. “I’ll keep walking whatever the weather. In the words of the song which Michael Ball has sung, in the rain or the fine, I’ll keep on walking.”
