Eric Dier has belatedly been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for climbing into the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium stands to confront an abusive fan after his team’s FA Cup penalty-shootout defeat by Norwich on 4 March. Dier’s case is being treated as “non-standard” by the FA – in other words, it is at the more serious end of the spectrum – and an independent regulatory commission will decide upon the Spurs player’s punishment. As with all non-standard cases, it will be evaluated on its own merits. If the FA suspends Dier it would start after the resumption of football – whenever that may be in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Dier has until Friday of next week to provide a response and he will surely cite as mitigation the fact that this youngest brother, Patrick, had become embroiled in an argument with the fan. Dier entered the stands to offer him protection. The brother was sitting close to the fan in a section of home seating. The FA does not condone players going into the crowd in an aggressive manner but Spurs would be extremely disappointed if Dier is suspended. An FA spokesperson said: “Eric Dier has been charged with misconduct for a breach of FA rule E3. It is alleged that the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder’s actions at the conclusion of the FA Cup fixture against Norwich were improper and/or threatening.”
