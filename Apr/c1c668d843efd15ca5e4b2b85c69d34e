The Danish side Midtjylland have installed giant screens in the parking lot of their MCH Arena to allow fans to watch matches from their cars when the Superliga resumes following its suspension for the coronavirus outbreak. In what the league leaders described as the best possible alternative to a full stadium, players inside the empty facility will also feel the presence of 10,000 fans with live footage of the car park screened inside the venue. “We’re working hard to create the best possible experience,” Midtjylland’s marketing director, Preben Rokkjaer, told the BBC. “The coronavirus does not change that, it just provides some other preconditions.” The club said more than 2,000 of their 12,000 parking spaces will be opened up around the club’s stadium and fans will also be able to access TV commentary through their car radios. They added that the success of the initiative in the first game will determine whether more places can be offered to fans. The Danish Superliga has been suspended indefinitely because of the virus. Denmark has more than 7,300 cases. Rokkjaer said the club were in touch with the police, the Herning municipality and the stadium authorities to create a safe framework and provide security for all fans. The Superliga plans to restart on 17 May with the aim of concluding the season by the end of July.
