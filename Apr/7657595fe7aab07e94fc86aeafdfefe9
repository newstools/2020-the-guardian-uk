As Ramadan began at the end of last week, Muslim communities across the UK were preparing to take the month of fasting, prayer and reflection online. Mosques were adapting to lockdown measures by using conferencing apps to keep in touch with worshippers and live stream lectures, courses and prayers, while others turned to chefs on YouTube for recipe inspiration. We’d like to hear from Muslims in the UK about how they are observing Ramadan during the lockdown. Are you taking part in online community iftars or prayer meets? How are you keeping in touch with your extended family and community? Have you taken part in any virtual initiatives, such as the Ramadan Tent Project, or other community projects?
