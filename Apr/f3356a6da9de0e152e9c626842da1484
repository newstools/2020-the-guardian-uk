In 1989 I directed a film for the Owen family, owners of British Racing Motors (BRM), for whom Stirling Moss drove in 1959. David Owen arranged for drivers to take part in three days of filming at Donington Park. Stirling was there to be reunited with his P25, a car he thought was the best the team had produced. His old skills were still in evidence as he sped around the Leicestershire circuit. This pre-dated the revolution in onboard cameras, so Stirling had to drive with the recording equipment in his lap. Despite this handicap he never complained.
