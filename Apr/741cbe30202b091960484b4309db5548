We were due to take the Eurostar from London to Avignon on 30 May, returning two weeks later. The outward leg has been cancelled, but the return appears to be running. Eurostar is allowing us to cancel and receive a voucher that must be spent by 30 September for travel before April next year. We currently have no idea if we will want to go to France next year. Even if we did, we would not want to travel before the end of May. JM, Shrewsbury Eurostar tells us that, contrary to what it says on its website, passengers who have bookings to its “seasonal” destinations (including Avignon) can rebook trips until June 2021. However, this still has to be done by the end of September. The better bet in your case is to wait until the return leg is cancelled, which looks highly likely, and then ask for a full refund. Eurostar has said you can do this, as set out in its T&Cs. It has provided a link on the Eurostar website for customers to ask for refunds. It really needs to scrap this September deadline and extend the voucher timescales. If it did so, more of its customers would be prepared to accept them.
