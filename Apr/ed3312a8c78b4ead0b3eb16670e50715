A man has died in hospital after being bitten by a shark near an island that has had three attacks in just over three months. The 23-year-old was swimming back to his charter boat with friends when he was attacked near North West Island, on the southern Great Barrier Reef, on Monday. The man suffered injuries to his leg, hand and elbow, and was flown to Gladstone hospital in a critical condition about 6pm after being treated by a doctor and paramedics who were sent to the scene. He died just after 10pm. A report will be prepared for the coroner. In early January, a nine-year-old girl was attacked by a shark off the same island. She suffered a bite wound to the back of her leg, and puncture wounds to her foot. A lemon shark was suspected of that attack. And in late December a shovelnose shark bit a man in shallow waters at North West Island. He suffered minor injuries to his right hand and leg. There have also been a series of other shark attacks on the Great Barrier Reef over the past 18 months. In October last year, two British backpackers were attacked while snorkelling at Hook Island in the Whitsunday Islands. One of the men lost his foot. In March last year, a 25-year-old man suffered serious thigh injuries when a shark attacked him at Hardy Reef, near Hamilton island, also in the Whitsundays chain. In November 2018 Victorian doctor Daniel Christidis, 33, was killed at Cid Harbour at Whitsunday Island.
