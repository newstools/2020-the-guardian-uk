My daughter, a community care worker, had several Covid-19 symptoms. As she is a key worker, a test was requested for her by her employer. However, in order to get the test done, she had to drive some distance while unwell. She lives in Hertfordshire and was offered a test at a drive-in centre either in Brent or Stansted. My daughter’s test was scheduled for midday but when she arrived at Brent she had to wait two hours. She tested positive and is not terribly well. It is high time that far more effort is made not only to increase provision of tests but also of local centres for people to be tested. A second issue arising from her illness relates to childcare. Her husband is very slowly recovering from the virus but needs much rest, and she needs rest because she is in the active phase of the disease. However, they are not able to have the rest they need because they have two children under five. Perhaps a register of nursery nurses and nursery/infant teachers who have had the virus could be drawn up so that these highly trained people could provide the help so desperately needed and those who need to be back at work have more chance of doing so sooner.Name and address supplied • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
