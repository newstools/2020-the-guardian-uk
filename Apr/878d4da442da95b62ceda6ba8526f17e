Making banana bread has become the go-to baking recipe for those in lockdown during the coronavirus crisis. There are good reasons for this: it is tasty, easy to make and we are forever looking for things to do with those bananas that have gone past the “slice on porridge” stage. A quick glance at the ingredients list and you will notice that sweet potato and quinoa are not regulars on a typical banana bread recipe, but I think they should be. The sweet potato allows you to lower the fat and sugar content, while also bringing a healthy dose of vitamin A and fibre. Quinoa gives a chewy, gooey stodge to the crumb while providing a protein hit. For those doing intense home workouts, you can also substitute some of the flour for protein powder. To really pimp it up, I like to toast and then spread with peanut butter (although that is my answer for everything). 2 bananas (1 needs to be large and very ripe)100g dark chocolate80g plain flour20g cocoa powder100g soft brown sugar2 tsp baking powderPinch of salt50g sweet potato30ml light olive oil (plus more for greasing)1 egg1 tsp vanilla150g cooked quinoa Line a 20cm loaf tin with foil, grease the inside and lay slices of one of the bananas on the base. Preheat oven to 170C (fan assisted). Roughly chop the dark chocolate into a large mixing bowl. Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder and salt, and mix all of these dry ingredients together. Finely grate the sweet potato and set aside. Blend the ripe banana, oil, egg, vanilla and quinoa until smooth, add to the sweet potato. Combine the wet and dry ingredients together, then pour over the sliced banana in the loaf tin. Bake for 40 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean). Turn upside down, gently remove the foil and then allow to cool.
