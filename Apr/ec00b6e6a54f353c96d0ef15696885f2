This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the National Galleries of Scotland, which comprises three galleries in Edinburgh: the Scottish National Gallery, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Together, they are home to one of the finest collections of art in the world, ranging from the early Renaissance to the 21st century, including masterpieces from Raphael, Velázquez, Titian and Vermeer to Van Gogh, Monet and Gauguin. The questions to the quiz are based around the collection of modern and contemporary art, which includes a world-class collection of dadaism and surrealism. You can see more about the collection of modern and contemporary art from National Galleries of Scotland on Art UK here. Find out more about the National Galleries of Scotland on its website here.
