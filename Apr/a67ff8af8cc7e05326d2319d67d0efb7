The former Chelsea player and manager, Gianluca Vialli, has been given the all-clear from pancreatic cancer. The former Italy striker, currently working with the national team, announced in 2018 that he had survived cancer before revealing last year the disease had returned. However Chelsea tweeted about the 55-year-old on Monday: “Gianluca Vialli has been given the all-clear following a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer. Amazing news.” Vialli played for Chelsea from 1996 until 1999, helping them win the FA Cup in 1997. He also became the first Italian to take charge of a Premier League when he was appointed player-manager at Stamford Bridge after Ruud Gullit was sacked in 1998. He went on to lead Chelsea to the Cup Winners’ Cup that year, before going on to manage Watford.
