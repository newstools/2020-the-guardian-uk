The actor Nigel Havers has launched a touring theatre company and plans to open its inaugural production of Noël Coward’s 1930 comedy Private Lives this autumn. Havers and Patricia Hodge will play the formerly married couple Elyot and Amanda who are horrified to re-encounter each other on honeymoon with their new partners. Surprisingly, it is Havers’s debut in a Coward play on stage. He has previous starred in a TV adaptation of Bon Voyage and recorded a BBC radio version of Brief Encounter, which Coward based on his play Still Life. The Private Lives tour is produced by David Pugh, who says his suggestion last year that Havers form a theatre company was met “with a wry smile” by the actor. “But he warmed to the idea and finally agreed that he would take 18 weeks out each year to tour a play.” He said Havers agreed, “as long as the play is entertaining and, most importantly, ticket prices are accessible to as many people as possible”. Theatres around the UK are currently closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pugh said that when they reopen, “we have to realise theatre can no longer be the luxury item it so often is. Theatre should be able to be seen by and be for everybody. Ticket pricing and ticketing charges have become ridiculous.” Private Lives will be directed by Christopher Luscombe. The tour is scheduled to open at Theatre Royal Bath on 1 October and will tour to venues including Norwich Theatre Royal, Newcastle Theatre Royal and the Grand in Leeds.
