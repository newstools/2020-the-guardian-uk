Is it a splendid hilltop where the views stretch out forever, a square in your favourite city or a sandy beach untouched except for the shack selling cold drinks and fresh fish? Maybe it’s just a cosy country pub filled with all your mates … This week we’d like you to tell us about that blissful spot you travel to in your imagination or memory when staying at home has got really stale. Use the form below to tell us about it – keeping your tip to about 100 words. Send your tip by Tuesday 5 May at 10am BST. We’re afraid that in these difficult times, there is no prize on offer for the week’s best entry – though hopefully that will return soon. But in the spirit of solidarity and optimism, we’d still love you share your memories with fellow readers. That also means you do not need to be a UK resident to submit a tip. Have a look at our past winners and other tips Photographs are very welcome if they are high-quality (at least 700 pixels wide please) and you are happy to share them but it is the text we will consider. If you do send photographs please ensure you are the copyright holder. The best tips will appear on the Guardian Travel website next week. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.
