Two asylum-seekers have been hospitalised with light injuries after gunshots were fired into Greece’s largest migrant camp on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos. The unknown assailant or assailants evaded arrest, while the two injured migrants were taken to the island’s hospital as a precaution, police said on Wednesday. No further detail was provided. The incident occurred late on Wednesday at the notoriously overcrowded Moria camp, which was designed to accommodate fewer than 3,000 people but which now contains more than 18,000. Lesbos is a major arrival point for thousands of migrants and refugees seeking a better life in Europe. They typically reach the island from the nearby Turkish coast in small, boats provided by smuggling rings.
