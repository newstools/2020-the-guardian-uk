Internazionale will reward Ashley Young with a new one-year deal after the full-back impressed his manager, Antonio Conte, and the club’s hierarchy after joining on an initial six-month contract from Manchester United. The 34-year-old made seven appearances for Inter before football in Italy shut down. Young signed for the remainder of the 2019-20 season with an option for another year, which Inter are ready to trigger. The club are third in Serie A, nine points behind the leaders, Juventus, who have 12 games remaining to Inter’s 13. Conte’s side are also in the last 16 of the Europa League, where they are due to face Getafe. Inter made the contract offer this week and the former England full-back has accepted the terms and is ready to sign it. Young spent nine years at Old Trafford after joining from Aston Villa in 2011, winning one Premier League title as well as the FA Cup, League Cup and the Europa League. This month he shared his thoughts on what do to in lockdown, tweeting: “This may sound harsh but treat everybody that’s not in your household as if they have the virus. You just don’t know! Most importantly, just stay safe! This is what we are doing here [in Italy], it’s not an overreaction, it’s staying safe. And just remember others should be looking at you in this way as well. It’s not horrible, it’s a way of keeping your distance to ultimately help save lives.”
