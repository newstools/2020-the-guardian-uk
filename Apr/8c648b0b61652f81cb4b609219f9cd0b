Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The World Health Organization has said it is “deeply concerned” over the development of Covid-19 in Europe. Regional director Dr Hans Henri P Kluge said the continent accounted for about half of confirmed cases globally and warned governments against relaxing lockdown measures. Spain has reported 757 deaths in the past 24 hours, a slight increase from the 743 deaths reported one day earlier. The virus has now claimed 14,555 lives in the country. But this week has seen the daily death toll grow by 5%, compared with around 9% one week earlier. “We have reached the peak of the curve and we are in a slowdown phase,” the country’s health minister, Salvador Illa, told parliament. Mumbai is to extend its current lockdown until at least 30 April. The city, which has a population of more than 20 million, has become the country’s coronavirus centre. Other parts of India are scheduled to lift restrictions on Tuesday. The UK is “nowhere near lifting the lockdown”, according to the London mayor. Sadiq Khan made the comments as the prime minister Boris Johnson remained in intensive care with symptoms of the virus. Singapore has announced plans to boost food production amid concerns over shortages. As part of the plans, the city-state, which only produces 10% of its food need, will turn car park rooftops into urban farms. Italy has closed its ports to migrant ships because of the epidemic. The decision, made by the government late last night, means charity migrant boats can no longer dock. Concerns are mounting over the spread of the virus in Greek refugee camps. The government has said new asylum requests will not be examined during the crisis, leaving thousands trapped in camps. A total of 1,832 cases have been confirmed in the country.
