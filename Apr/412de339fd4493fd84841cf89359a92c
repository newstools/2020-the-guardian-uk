I am an intensive care unit doctor at Royal Preston hospital. ICU staff are dealing with Covid-19 patients daily, and are especially exposed to infection because of the nature of intensive care procedures. Every day brings news of healthcare workers contracting and dying of Covid-19. The majority of these souls are, like myself, foreign healthcare workers. I see worry on my wife’s face every day I go to work. I understand she is imagining what will happen if I get the infection. What if I transmit the infection to our beloved son or to her? Will they be deported if I die? We were actually in the process of buying a home. What will happen to my family if I die and my wife has to pay a mortgage for a home they can’t live in? I hear many of my non-UK citizen colleagues echo these concerns. We are really worried. The government recently announced a one-year visa extension for foreign nationals who have expired visas. Is our need only limited while this pandemic lasts? Will our services then be no longer required? I and my colleagues believe the government should grant indefinite leave to remain to all foreign NHS staff. They will then have the right to permanently and freely reside in the UK without fear of deportation. It will give them the reassurance that the life they have built in the UK will be protected and their sacrifice is valued. Our plea is backed by the BMA and by a letter from 60 MPs to Priti Patel (Report, theguardian.com, 7 April). There is also a petition to parliament at tinyurl.com/NHScitizens (Letters, 8 April) with over 32,000 signatures.Dr Mohammed ElshamyPreston • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
