Umar Akmal has been banned from all cricket for three years after the Pakistan batsman failed to report details of corrupt approaches made to him in two separate incidents. The 29-year-old, who has played in 16 Tests, 121 one-day internationals and 84 Twenty20s, was charged by the ­Pakistan Cricket Board for two breaches of its anti-corruption code, having been provisionally suspended in February before the start of the ­Pakistan Super League. He was due to represent Quetta Gladiators in the PSL’s opening game in Karachi. Akmal decided to represent himself at Monday’s hearing at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. Lt Col Asif Mahmood, the ­director of PCB security and anti-corruption, said: “The PCB doesn’t take any ­pleasure in seeing a promising ­international being declared ineligible for three years on corruption charges but this is a timely reminder to all who think they can get away by breaching the anti-­corruption code. I request all ­professional cricketers to stay away from the ­menace of corruption and ­immediately inform relevant ­authorities as soon as they are approached. This is in their as well as their teams’ and ­country’s best interest.” A PCB spokesman added: “He cannot play cricket at any level now. The detailed verdict will be issued by the panel later.” Akmal’s career has been marred by disciplinary problems since he made his Test debut 11 years ago. He was sent home from England in 2017 when he failed a fitness test before the ­Champions Trophy that Pakistan won. He made a century in his debut Test against New Zealand in 2009 but only played 15 more for his country, scoring 1,003 runs. His last Test was against Zimbabwe in 2011.
