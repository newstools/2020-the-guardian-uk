Peel 1 large onion and chop it finely, then let it soften in 2 tbsp of groundnut oil in a deep, nonstick pan. When it has started to colour lightly, add half a tsp of yellow mustard seeds, a couple of finely chopped hot red chillies, half a tsp of turmeric, 1 tsp each of ground cumin and coriander, and stir for a minute or so until the spices are warm and fragrant. Chop 400g of tomatoes, add them to the pan and leave to soften for 5 minutes before pouring in 80ml water. Stir in 1 tbsp of tamarind paste and 200ml of coconut milk. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer. Leave for 10 minutes then add 1kg of scrubbed mussels, some salt and a little black pepper. Cover with a lid. (It’s worth noting that during the current trading conditions, you may find it easier to buy mussels online.) Now leave to cook for 3 or 4 minutes until the mussel shells open. Serve as it is, or if you wish, with rice. It is worth arming everyone with a spoon so as not to waste a drop of the gently spiced juices. Enough for 2 Get the sauce to the right consistency before you add the mussels. I like the sauce to be quite soupy, so I can scoop it up with a spoon and some rice, in which case I simmer for 5 minutes only before adding the mussels. If you like a thicker sauce, then give it up to 15 minutes. Much will depend on whether you are eating it with rice or bread. Introduce a touch more sourness if you wish by increasing the tamarind paste, 1 tsp at a time. You could use clams in place of the mussels, or pieces of salmon or other firm fish, such as cod or haddock. Cut any large fillets into thick strips so they cook quickly. Prawns on the shell are a splendid idea if you aren’t averse to getting your fingers messy. Depending on what I have around, I often add coriander or fresh mint leaves when I put the mussels in.
