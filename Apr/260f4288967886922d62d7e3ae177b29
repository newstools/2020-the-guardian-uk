The maker of a popular brand of household cleaner has urged users not to inject it into their bodies in the wake of comments by Donald Trump at the daily White House briefing that injections of disinfectant might be a treatment or cure for the coronavirus. Lysol, which is owned by a British company, is widely used as a spray to clean household surfaces and has become a vital tool for Americans seeking to disinfect their houses and apartments during the pandemic. But the firm was clear no one should do anything else with its product, despite Trump’s bizarre claims at his daily press conference on Thursday evening and which were denounced widely by health experts as “jaw-dropping”. “We must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said a spokesperson for Reckitt Benckiser, the United Kingdom-based owner of Lysol, in a statement to NBC News. “As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information,” the statement continued. At Thursday’s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, Trump had discussed new government research on how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces. “Is there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning?” Trump had mused. Trump has a record of defying science – from pollution to the climate crisis – and also used the briefing to float the idea of treating coronavirus patients’ bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light. When he turned to the senior member of the White House coronavirus taskforce present, health expert Deborah Birx, to ask if she had heard about light and heat in relation to the coronavirus. “Not as a treatment,” she said.
