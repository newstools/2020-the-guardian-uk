Jimmy Greaves has been released from hospital and is recovering at home after being taken ill last week. A statement on the former England, Chelsea and Tottenham striker’s Facebook page said: “We are delighted to let you all know that Jimmy is now back at home recuperating with his wife Irene. He has been very ill and we are hoping he will be fine going forward.” Greaves, who turned 80 in February, suffered a severe stroke in May 2015 that left him having to use a wheelchair. Spurs issued a statement last week saying their record goalscorer had not had another stroke nor tested positive for the coronavirus. That echoed information published on his Facebook page, which is run by his friend and agent, Terry Baker. No further details of his condition have been announced, with the family asking for privacy. “If and when there is any more news we will let you all know,” the statement added. “Thanks to the thousands of you that sent goodwill messages. We love that so many of you still hold Jimmy so dear to your hearts and it’s lovely to know there is still so much love for him in the world.”
