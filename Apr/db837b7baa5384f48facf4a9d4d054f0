This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the National Trust, which looks after one of the world’s largest and most significant holdings of fine art and heritage objects – a treasure chest of history. The organisation conserves a huge range of heritage locations with buildings, contents, gardens and settings intact, and provides extensive public access. You can see art from the National Trust on Art UK here. Find out more on the National Trust website here.
