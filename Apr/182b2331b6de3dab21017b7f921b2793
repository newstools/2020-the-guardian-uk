For those wanting to make a statement about Covid-19 without following the crowd of rainbows, Gilbert & George are here to help. They’re the latest artists to offer up some free downloadable art for your living room window – although their take is a little different from the rest. “Gilbert & George say: Don’t catch it!” screams one poster. “Gilbert & George say: Don’t get it!” declares another. You have been warned. The artworks are part of an initiative from the artist Sam Harris, whose website the Online Art Show boasts the motto “If you can’t come to art then art will come to you” and features a selection of artists’ work to buy online. “It was an idea I had for artists to display art they had for sale,” says Harris. “The site takes you to their Instagram account or website so you can contact them to buy the artworks.” Harris’s website is an extension of his print zine Pure Filth which features 80 artists including the likes of Jake and Dinos Chapman and Noel Fielding. Gilbert & George are not the only artists offering free window displays. The site also features art by Hayden Kays, otherwise known as the favourite artist of Harry Styles. Kays’ work comes in two parts, each featuring a different half of a rainbow – the first asks you to “stay home”, the second requests you “stay homo”. It’s not the only recent bit of public art Gilbert & George have been involved with. The duo were last seen glazing their work on to crockery and selling it for £125 a pop to raise money for the homeless. It was a rare philanthropic initiative for the Conservative-voting pair, which they worried could cause lasting damage to their reputation as “horrid people”.
