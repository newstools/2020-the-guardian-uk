George Monbiot’s article (22 April) about golf courses and land owned by private schools in London is illustrated by a picture of golfers on Wimbledon Park golf course. Their privilege is nothing new. I grew up in the area and recall an aerial photo of Wimbledon Park Lake taken during the war, showing the adjacent public park and the golf course. The park had been dug up for allotments. The golf course remained a golf course. Something to discuss at the 19th hole?Dr David CooperNewbury, Berkshire • The golf club I’m a member of, Cuckfield golf centre, is open for local people to walk during this testing time (Letters, 23 April). It has spectacular views – good for the mind as well as the body. Make the most of it while you can.Chris SmithBurgess Hill, West Sussex • What a pity there was no mention of Nicola Sturgeon (Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?, 25 April), who shows an encouraging openness, honesty and sureness of touch at her daily press conferences – so much more reassuring and confidence-building than what we see from Downing Street.Norman ShanksGlasgow • Good news that the ECB is hoping to salvage some of the county cricket season (Coronavirus crisis makes Hundred even more essential, claims ECB chief, 24 April). My experience of watching the game suggests that social distancing is never a problem.Liz FullerLondon • Austen Lynch (Letters, 24 April) is probably right to say that Dominic Raab ultracrepidates. To be fair, this is normal in a kakistocracy.Michael ShipmanLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
