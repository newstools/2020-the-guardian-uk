This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by y Gaer Museum, Art Gallery and Library. Y Gaer is a new cultural venue in Brecon, bringing together Brecknock Museum and Brecon Library as a community resource for the people of Brecon, Wales and the world. The collection contains works such as Augustus John’s Welsh Mountains, Iwan Bala’s Santes Mariona and numerous works by Josef Herman. You can see art from y Gaer Museum, Art Gallery and Library on Art UK here. Find out more about the venue here.
