Yayoi Kusama, one of the world’s most popular living artists, has responded to the global coronavirus crisis with a message of defiance. The reclusive 91-year-old, celebrated for her polka-dot artworks and installations, has written what she says is a message to the whole world. It takes the form of a poem, in which Kusama says it is time “to fight and overcome our unhappiness” to “fight this terrible monster”. Kusama has had hugely popular touring shows across the US and Europe in recent years, as well as large-scale solo shows in Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Taiwan. In 2017, a five-storey museum dedicated to her work opened in Tokyo. Much of Kusama’s work is characterised by obsessiveness and a desire to escape psychological trauma. Open about her own mental-health issues, Kusama has lived voluntarily in a Japanese psychiatric institution since 1977. This is the text of her message: Today, with the world facing Covid-19, I feel the necessity to address it with this message: A MESSAGE FROM YAYOI KUSAMA TO THE WHOLE WORLD Though it glistens just out of reach, I continue to pray for hope to shine through Its glimmer lighting our way This long-awaited great cosmic glow  Now that we find ourselves on the dark side of the world The gods will be there to strengthen the hope we have spread throughout the universe  For those left behind, each person’s story and that of their loved ones It is time to seek a hymn of love for our souls In the midst of this historic menace, a brief burst of light points to the future Let us joyfully sing this song of a splendid future Let’s go  Embraced in deep love and the efforts of people all over the world Now is the time to overcome, to bring peace We gathered for love and I hope to fulfil that desire The time has come to fight and overcome our unhappiness  To Covid-19 that stands in our way I say Disappear from this earth We shall fight We shall fight this terrible monster Now is the time for people all over the world to stand up My deep gratitude goes to all those who are already fighting.
