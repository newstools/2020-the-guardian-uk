Gary Anderson’s dodgy internet connection has put paid to his chances of competing in the Professional Darts Corporation’s inaugural home event. The competition was set up to entertain darts fans stuck at home owing to the coronavirus pandemic and will launch on Friday evening featuring 128 top players squaring off against each other from their homes using video calls. But the two-times PDC world champion will not be at the oche. “I was up for it but when we did tests of my wifi, it’s just not reliable enough,” Anderson told the Sun. “It doesn’t surprise me. I struggle to pay bills online in my house, it’s really frustrating.” He was injured for part of the 2019 season and was looking forward to making a strong return before the outbreak of coronavirus brought the global sporting calendar to a standstill. “It’s unbelievable,” he said. “Two years on the trot I’ve missed the opening few months.”
