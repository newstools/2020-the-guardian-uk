With all of us confined to our homes for the near future, this week we are asking for reminiscences of your great holidays through photography – a lovely way of recalling past travel glories. Landscape shots, people shots, fun family snaps, architecture, wildlife, cities, countryside … the choice is yours. But bear in mind your personal story behind the photo is as important as the quality of the image itself. Please ensure your tip stays around 100 words.
