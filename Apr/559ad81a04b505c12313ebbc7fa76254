David Moyes is taking a voluntary 30% pay cut at West Ham to help the club through the financial problems caused by the coronavirus crisis. Moyes is the third Premier League manager known to have agreed a wage reduction, after Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe and Brighton’s Graham Potter. The move comes as talks continue at top-flight clubs, also involving the Professional Footballers’ Association, with a view to reducing player wages at a time when income streams have dried up. West Ham have not furloughed any staff and plan to inject at least £30m into the club by launching a rights issue.
