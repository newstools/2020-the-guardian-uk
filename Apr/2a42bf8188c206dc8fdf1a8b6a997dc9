Fifa has extended the age limit for the men’s football tournament at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics to 24 from 23. Following the Games’ postponement due to the coronavirus pandemic, the amended rule retains the original stipulation regarding teams being based around players born on or after 1 January 1997, but given the Olympics’ move to 2021 this now means older players will be allowed to participate. It means players eligible for the intended under-23 tournament in 2020 can still play in Japan at age 24 next year. The men’s football tournament will kick off before the 23 July 2021 opening ceremony in Tokyo. The 16 men’s teams can also select three over-age players in their rosters, unlike the women’s competition that has no age limit. Due to line up in the men’s tournament are Argentina, holders Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, New Zealand, Egypt, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and hosts Japan. Fifa has also postponed two women’s age-group World Cups due this year in Central America and India, and confirmed no international games for men and women will be played in the early June dates protected for national team call-ups. The Women’s Under-20 World Cup, due to be hosted by Panama and Costa Rica in August and September will be rescheduled, along with the Under-17s tournament originally earmarked for India in November.
