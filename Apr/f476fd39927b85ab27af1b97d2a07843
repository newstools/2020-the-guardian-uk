Wilson Kipsang, the former marathon world record holder, was among 20 people arrested in Kenya for locking themselves in a bar and drinking alcohol in breach of a curfew imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Police say the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist was among those detained at a police station in Iten, a high-altitude town in Kenya where distance runners train. They were in breach of a 7pm to 5am curfew. The group included a local politician. Kipsang, who is also a police officer, was provisionally suspended this year from track and field and charged with doping offences that include tampering with doping samples. He has also won the New York, London and Berlin marathons. Twelve athletes were arrested in Iten earlier this week for breaching Kenyan government regulations on social gatherings during the Covid-19 crisis. The runners were arrested for training in a group, a practice which has been banned in Kenya. Training camps have been shut down and athletes must train alone.
