This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Museums Sheffield, a charity that cares for the city’s collections of art, history and natural science. Its art includes British and European pieces from the 16th century to the present day, as well as works that directly illustrate the city’s history. Its strength lies in the modern British collection, which includes artists such as Frank Auerbach, Vanessa Bell, David Bomberg, Gwen John and Stanley Spencer.
