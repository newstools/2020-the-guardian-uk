A Pakistani court has commuted the death sentence of a British-born man convicted of the 2002 kidnapping and murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and acquitted three co-accused. At least four people were convicted in connection with Pearl’s murder, including Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh who was sentenced to death in 2002 for masterminding the killing. He has been in jail for 18 years awaiting the outcome of an appeal. “The court has commuted Omar’s death sentence to a seven-year sentence,” Khawaja Naveed, the defence lawyer told Reuters by telephone. “The murder charges were not proven, so he was given seven years for the kidnapping. “Omar has already served 18 years, so his release orders will be issued sometime today. He will be out in a few days.” A two-member bench of the high court of Sindh province issued the order in the city of Karachi on Thursday, Naveed said. He said the three others, who had been serving life sentences in connection with the case, had been acquitted. Pearl was investigating Islamist militants in Karachi after the 9/11 attacks when he was kidnapped in January 2002. Video emerged a few weeks later of his murder. A Sindh prosecutor said he would consider appealing against the court’s decision. “We will go through the court order once it is issued, we will probably file an appeal,” said Faiz Shah, the provincial prosecutor general. Sheikh, who was born in Britain and studied at the London School of Economics, was arrested in India in the 1990s for his involvement in the kidnapping of western tourists in 1994. He was one of three men released from an Indian prison after militants hijacked an Indian airliner in late 1999 and flew it to Afghanistan, where the then ruling Taliban regime helped negotiate an exchange.
