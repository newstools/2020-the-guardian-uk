I usually think of Easter as a second chance at Christmas: the only other time of year that my family gathers under one roof to gorge on chocolate and moan about the lack of good telly. But I’m not sure how things will work this year – perhaps we’ll convene on Houseparty to eat our respective lamb roasts instead? However you spend this Easter, turning any remains of your chocolate glut into truffles is a simple, fun way to spend some of your isolation time. Prep 45 minCook 5 minChill 2 hrsMakes About 10 Instead of passionfruit juice or pomegranate molasses, you can substitute whichever fruit juice you happen to have already. Concentrate more weakly flavoured juices, such as orange, by boiling for a couple of minutes before using. 80g honey80g double cream100g dark chocolateCocoa powder, for coating 50g passionfruit juice50g double cream100g milk chocolateCocoa powder, for coating 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses80g double cream1/4 tsp rosewater100g dark chocolate60g unsalted pistachios, ground in a food processor, for coating To make the passionfruit and pomegranate truffles, warm the cream with the juice or molasses in a small saucepan over a low heat. With the heat off, stir the chocolate through, until it melts to become smooth and glossy, then pour the mixture into a bowl and chill in the fridge for two hours. For the honey truffles, first caramelise the honey by simmering it in a small saucepan over a low-medium heat for two minutes, then add the cream and stir to combine. With the heat off, stir through the chocolate until completely melted, then pour into a bowl and leave to cool in the fridge for two hours. Once the truffles have chilled, use a teaspoon to take small scoops of the mix, then roll into balls with your hands. Coat in cocoa powder to finish or, for the pomegranate truffles, roll in the ground pistachios.
