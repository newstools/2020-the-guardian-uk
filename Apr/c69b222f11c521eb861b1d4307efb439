Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper. My son is due to turn nine in a couple of weeks and we would usually throw him a party with some of his friends. Instead there will just be the four of us (I’ve got a six-year-old too). What can we do to replace the celebrations? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, the Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
