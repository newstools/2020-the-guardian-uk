Places of worship in the UK have been closed since March with celebrations such as weddings cancelled until further notice. Whether you have celebrated a barmitzvah online, are accessing prayers and reflections in a different way, or participating in virtual Iftar we would like to hear from you. How are you worshipping during the pandemic? Have your death rituals been affected? We are also interested in hearing from faith leaders, as well as those who are more open to faith during this time.
