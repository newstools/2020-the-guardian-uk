This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today our questions are set by English Heritage, which cares for more than 400 historic sites – and their contents – across England. There are more than 750,000 artefacts in the English Heritage collection, with another 46,000 on long-term loan, ranging from Roman coins to paintings by Turner and Rembrandt. From Cornwall to Cumbria, they are spread across England, in castles and churches, historic houses and halls. You can see art from English Heritage on Art UK here.
