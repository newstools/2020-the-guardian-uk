George Monbiot points out that the UK dismissed early warnings about coronavirus, spending billions on the arms industry while ignoring real threats (What does ‘national defence’ mean in a pandemic? It’s no time to buy fighter jets, Journal, 8 April). This Covid-19 crisis focuses our minds on where priorities really lie; the NHS will undoubtedly emerge as a frontrunner. We need to spend on “national defence” because that is a prime responsibility of government, but it should be commensurate with our national income and with the real threats facing our nation. In that light, one has to question whether spending between £2bn and £3bn per year (actual government figures are hard to come by) on maintaining a Trident submarine on constant nuclear deterrent patrol at sea – when the missiles are not targeted and have been at “several days’ notice to fire” for over 20 years for lack of any perceived nuclear threat – is now a proper use of our rapidly vanishing national financial resources. This is on top of some £60bn-plus to replace the submarines, their missiles and other assorted costs associated with Trident.Cmdr Robert Forsyth RN (Ret’d)Former executive officer of a Polaris submarine and nuclear submarine commanding officerCmdr Robert Green RN (Ret’d)Former Fleet Air Arm nuclear-armed aircraft bombardier-navigator • George Monbiot deserves a prize for his article – such clear common sense. It makes it even more ludicrous that, despite spending £205bn on a new generation of nuclear weapons, the end product will not even remotely be “independent”. We have to borrow from the US, on a rotating basis, the missiles on which to put our nuclear warheads. A sign of foolish national vanity? Certainly. Theft from the NHS? Inevitably. Immoral and useless? Undoubtedly.Bruce KentVice-president, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
