Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine began last week, the latest stage in Oxford University’s race to find a formula which could end lockdown and save millions of lives. More than 500 healthy adults, aged 18 to 55, were recruited by researchers to test the vaccine. We’d like to speak to those who signed up for the trials. We’re keen to learn about why you volunteered, what the experience has been like so far, and what you’re expecting from your trial going forward. We’d also like to hear from people who have participated in any other coronavirus trials. Please tell us what they are and what your experience with them has been.
