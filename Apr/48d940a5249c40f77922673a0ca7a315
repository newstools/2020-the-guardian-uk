On my daily walk from the station to my office in Donauwörth, near Munich, I see this tiny cherry tree. It lives in a crevice in a garage wall. The owners regularly cut it down. Every time that happens, I hope against hope that it will make it once again. I’ve been following its miserable existence for years. The little thing just won’t give up and knowing it is there makes me so happy. Last year, when it was very small once again, I laminated a photograph showing it in much better condition and stuck that in a crack in the wall next to the tree with a note asking the owners to let it keep at least one twig. At the moment, it has just started to wake up again while I am confined to working from home 70 miles away. I wish it well while it has to fend for itself, and I can’t wait to see it again – in better times, hopefully for all of us. • Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in the form.
