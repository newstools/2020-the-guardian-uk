Welcome back! It’s week four of our Spooks series one watch along, and I’ll be sitting in for Sarah Hughes, who is unwell but will hopefully be back in the swivel chair next week. So far we’ve had The First Ever Episode, The One With The Deep Fat Fryer, and The One Where Zoe Gets Taken Hostage In The Turkish Consulate But Then It Turns Out The Whole Thing Is A Distraction. We’ve also built up an increasingly powerful community of old fans, first-time viewers (so no spoilers please) and people who actually wrote Spooks in the comments section. Tonight: episode four. Anthony Head AND Hugh Laurie are in it. What more of a sales pitch do you need than that? Join us! • Get ready to hit play at 7pm BST (on BBC iPlayer in the UK, and Britbox in the US, where the show is called MI-5)
