The Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius is close to cancelling his contract with Besiktas after a dispute over unpaid wages. Karius, who joined the Turkish club on a two-year loan in 2018, has filed a complaint to Fifa saying he has not been paid since the Super Lig season was suspended last month and he wants to terminate his contract. It is the second time he has reported Besiktas to Fifa, having been owed four months’ pay last season. That dispute was resolved and it appears the latest fallout will be settled without Fifa’s intervention. The parties are close to mutually agreeing to cancel the 26-year-old’s contract, with Karius receiving £400,000 in outstanding salary. Besiktas paid £2.25m to take the former Mainz keeper on loan with an option to make the deal permanent for an extra £7.25m this summer. Their acrimonious parting has put an end to that and Karius, a regular starter in Turkey, will officially return to Liverpool from 30 June. He has not played for Liverpool since the calamitous Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid in 2018 and remains under contract until 2022.
