I understand that there are 1,249 McDonald’s restaurants in this country, all now mothballed. About two-thirds have a drive-through service. Everyone knows where they are. They are located in population centres, on A roads close to motorway junctions. It would take no more than six Royal Army Medical Corps nurses at every one to take valid samples from people at an appropriately constructed testing point at the end of the drive-through queue. The existing serving hatches are inappropriate. There is ample space in a five-star food hygiene environment for refrigeration, freezing and washing. Once sampled, it will be easy for a refrigerated van to remove batches to the motorway junction for a lorry to collect and deliver to a central laboratory within five hours from anywhere in the country.Eddy BaytonLancaster • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
