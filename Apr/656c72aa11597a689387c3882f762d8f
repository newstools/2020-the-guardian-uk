Colette Bryce was born in Derry in 1970 and has received many awards for her work. A significant editor of poetry magazines, she is the incoming editor of Poetry Ireland Review in 2020. Although the poem here was written well over a decade ago, it acquires a glittering sense of loss, a prescience, in these days when we leave our homes for the briefest of times and walk carefully apart. Carpe diem, we might think, as we read the gentle, human noticing of this poem. If only my bag had been large enough,I would have brought the lonely men in parked carsby the river. I would have brought the womandabbing kohl tears with the heelof her hand. I might have brought the ancient couplewho read each word on the YOU ARE HEREboard, then turned and ambled on, headsa little upward-tilted, showingan interest in everything. I would have brought the coping-stonefrom the twelfth pier of the original bridge, and the 4:06from elsewhere, curving (glittering) carefully across.And all the busy people on it: all their coatsand phones and wallets. I mighthave brought the restless gulls that droppedlike paper boats on to the water. And the burger van,the girl inside with greasy hair,her quite unsolvable crossword. And put them all on my nature table,and fashioned little cardboard signs:a small display that would speak in a wayabout loneliness and life spans, parked cars and rivers. I brought some bark, and a couple of conkers,one still half-encased in its skin like an eye. â€¢ From Self-Portrait in the Dark, published by Picador, 2008
