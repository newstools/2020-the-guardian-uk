Facebook reported its slowest quarterly growth as a public company, pressured by a global slowdown in the digital advertising market due to the coronavirus pandemic. Like Google on Tuesday, the social network said it was feeling the squeeze from the global pandemic but expects to weather it with modest long-term effects. Facebook said it earned $4.9bn, or $1.71 per share, in the January-March quarter. That is more than double the $2.43, or 85 cents per share, it reported in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to $17.74bn from $15.08bn. Facebookâ€™s stock shot up more than 7% in after-hours trading after the results came out.
