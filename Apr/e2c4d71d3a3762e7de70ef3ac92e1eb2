The current lockdown will be affecting people in many different ways, from being anxious to overwhelmed or sad. We’d like to hear from people who have been feeling lonely during their self-isolation, whether they have been quarantined alone or with others. We’d like to understand how the lockdown might have increased pre-existing feelings of loneliness or whether these feelings are new, whether video calling or other tech is helping to alleviate your isolation and if you have found any coping mechanisms or lessons to take forward for when our lockdown period ends.
