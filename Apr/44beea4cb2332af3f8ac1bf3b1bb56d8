In lieu of Hofesh Shechter’s planned shows that were to open this year’s Brighton festival, you can see a screen version of one half of the programme, Clowns. It was originally made for the stage in 2016, filmed at south London’s Rivoli Ballroom in 2018 and is now available on BBC iPlayer as part of the Performance Live series. The simple setup of this half-hour dance works brilliantly on film. Shechter himself directs – he wrote the music, too, his is always a complete vision – and he takes advantage of the medium, blurring woozily in and out of focus on tiny details, stretching and compressing time. It’s all done with a light touch. Shechter’s work gets under the skin. His music is part of that, the bounding drumbeat on unflagging loop, matched by the repetitive riffs of his dancers. And even without narrative he’s able to create a genuine sense of drama. Ten dancers present themselves to the audience, holding hands like guests at a Regency ball. But from a gentle upright jig they fall into crooked-backed, gnarly gallops. There’s civility on the surface, but you can’t hide the ugliness of humanity underneath for long. That’s a very Shechter-esque theme. Clowns descends into an orgy of highly choreographed violence. You’d think it OTT until you remember that’s every action film or grisly crime drama. This is what we like to watch, isn’t it? He’s goading us. For fun? We may barely blink at multiple murders on TV, but garotted bodies still tap-dancing, their feet like gunfire? Presented in dance, not a weapon or blood squib in sight, it sticks in the throat. Less realism leads to more disgust somehow, which is something to mull on while being wooed by Shechter’s clowns.
