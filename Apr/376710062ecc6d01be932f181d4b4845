Bayern Munich head coach Hansi Flick has agreed a new contract with the Bundesliga champions until June 2023. The 55-year-old had joined the club at the start of the season as Niko Kovac’s assistant coach but was promoted as interim manager when the Croat was sacked on 3 November. Flick earned a deal until the end of the season as permanent head coach in December and has since convinced Bayern’s hierarchy he is the man to lead the team for the next three seasons after winning 18 of his 21 matches in charge. “Bayern are very satisfied with Hansi Flick’s work,” said Bayern’s chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. “The team has had a very good development under him, plays attractive football which is reflected in results. We are the only club still competing in all three competitions.” Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic added: “Hansi and I know in which direction we want to develop the team. We believe that Hansi is also the right head coach for the current time.”
