This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by York Art Gallery (York Museums Trust). The York collection ranges from 14th-century panel paintings to contemporary sculpture, including many works by York-born William Etty. Inspired by Etty, a champion of the nude, the Gallery has a unique collecting strand that focuses on acquiring contemporary representations of flesh. The collection of 20th-century studio pottery is the world’s most extensive and representative of British studio ceramics. You can see art from York Museums Trust on Art UK here.
