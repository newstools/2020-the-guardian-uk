Noel Gallagher has discovered a previously lost Oasis song that he plans to release at midnight on Thursday 30 April. The track is a demo of a song called Don’t Stop …, which was never released or worked up into a studio recording. Gallagher  tweeted that the only previous version of the song was from a recording of a soundcheck at an Oasis concert in Hong Kong “about 15 years ago”, and that he wasn’t sure of the demo recording’s date. He said: “I’ve had infinite time to kill lately so I thought I’d finally look and find out what was actually on the hundreds of faceless unmarked CDs I’ve got lying around at home. As fate would have it, I have stumbled across an old demo which I thought had been lost for ever.” He added: “Hope everyone is staying safe and trying to ride out the lockdown with a minimum of fuss. You’re welcome by the way.” pic.twitter.com/1FhN6oIurU After Oasis’s split in 2009, Gallagher has released three albums with his band Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, as well as a number of EP releases. The most recent was Blue Moon Rising last month. Fans still hold out hope for an Oasis reunion despite a long-standing feud between Gallagher and his brother Liam. “I’ve often thought, let’s just do a gig,” he told British Vogue last month. “But I realised I would only be doing it to shut this fucking idiot up. The only other thing I could come up with was burning his house down or smashing his car in … but that’s not going to solve anything, is it?” Liam Gallagher, who recently announced a free concert for NHS workers, has proposed an Oasis reunion concert to benefit coronavirus relief.
