Authorities in Kentucky said four children died and one is missing after a buggy carrying an Amish family was swept away in the current while trying to cross a low-water bridge. Six people were in the horse and buggy that overturned on Wednesday in Salt Lick, Bath county, Kentucky state police said in a statement. The adult in the buggy was able to make it to the bank of the stream and call for help, police said. The four siblings were found and pronounced dead by a coroner’s office on Wednesday. Trooper Scott Ferrell of Kentucky state police said authorities from various agencies were continuing to search on Thursday for the last missing child. Missi Mosley and her boyfriend told local station WYMT-TV that they rushed to the scene on their ATV after hearing the call go out on the scanner. “It was devastating,” Mosley said. “The waters are so swift and the rain was pouring down. It was just a somber feeling.” Despite searching all night, emergency crews had not yet found a missing fifth child on Thursday morning, the Lexington Herald Leader reported. Authorities were notified of the accident about late Wednesday afternoon. The buggy overturned when the horse lost its footing and the children were thought to be siblings. We’ve seen several people head towards the scene in what looks to be military uniforms. I’ve reached out asking if members of the National Guard will be assisting. Here was one bus pulling in. @WKYT pic.twitter.com/w35NWEXExH Multiple local and federal agencies were involved in the rescue, recovery and ongoing search. Ferrell said that Kentucky National Guard troops arrived to help search efforts in the remote area, where people were searching on foot, on ATVs and in kayaks. Helicopters were expected to arrive later in the day if the weather permitted. He said the rain stopped falling overnight, which allowed the water to recede some and should help search efforts.
