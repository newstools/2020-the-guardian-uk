The one egg I want, every year, and despite heavy hinting I never get, is Hotel Chocolat’s Extra Thick Just Milk Chocolate Egg, £29. I love a thick egg, because it’s virtually impossible to break off a weeny bit. At Easter it has to be milk for me and this one is half 40% chocolate and half 50% with truffly things in the middle. It also comes in a reusable tin: plus points. For dark chocolate fans the Extra Thick Rare & Vintage, £31, is the one to go for. Most surprising was Divine’s Hot Cross Bun Egg, £10. You’ll love or hate it: it has raisins and spiced biscuit mixed into the shell and inside it has milk chocolate eggs (which were devoured by younger testers). I didn’t expect to like it, broke off a bit for testing and… ate a lot. If mini eggs are your thing - those tiny eggs in a sugar-coated shell – you might want to try Doisy & Dam’s 70% cocoa version, Good Eggs, £1.79, which somehow lessen the feelings of dismay when you devour a whole bag. If you are able to get to a supermarket – or have a delivery slot – and fancy picking up something more exotic than the usual ‘high street favourites’, look out for Monty Bojangles. These eggs are good if you’re not sure if you want dark or milk chocolate as the egg appeals to milk lovers and if you get one with the truffles, they appeal to darker chocolate lovers. They start at £10. My fave is Choccy Scoffy. A gorgeous luxe choice is Rococo’s Floral Egg: 72% dark chocolate flavoured with rose oil and filled with rose and violet fondant creams, £32.95. Beautifully packaged, it’s understated and classy.
