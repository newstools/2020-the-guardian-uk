Bill Beaumont faces competition in his bid to be re-elected as World Rugby chairman after the vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, launched his campaign. Pichot, the former Argentina and Bristol captain, announced on Twitter that he is running for the role. The 45-year-old claimed the crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak was an opportunity for “global realignment” of rugby. Beaumont announced in January that he was standing for a second four-year term with the French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Laporte, as his proposed vice-chairman. Pichot, who also had a spell with Richmond in the late 1990s, wrote: “Women and men, we all fight for and believe in fair, equal and more inclusive world. Do we? If so, it is time to make these dreams a reality for our sport, rugby. “It is time to think of a sport where professional and commercial income is becoming a true benefit for all, by empowering rugby’s growth around the world and by moving on from the time where those benefits were for just a few.” The former scrum-half added: “It is a critical time and a critical election. The current crisis is an opportunity for the global realignment of our game. We cannot miss it.” “It is time to align our global calendar and demonstrate our strategic intent to attract the sustainable investment we need, or risk falling back to individual handouts and rants in the absence of a long-term vision for a global game. It is time to change, to focus our attention, love and dedication to all unions and federations equally.” The election is due to be held in May.
