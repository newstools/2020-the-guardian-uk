I like to think of dance like she‚Äôs my oldest friend who I turn to in times of my greatest joys and greatest pains. I am so grateful to get to jump in her arms during this time. She‚Äôs that friend that you want everyone you know to meet. So I‚Äôm sharing her with you. Hope this brings you some of her comfort and joy. #NoMoreRoom #emilyking @emilykingmusic @itsjarosz #dance #roofseries #coronarelief A post shared by  Robbie Fairchild (@robbiefairchild) on Mar 20, 2020 at 12:43pm PDT Possibly the best thing to come out of lockdown. Ex-New York City Ballet dancer turned Broadway and Cats star Robbie Fairchild dancing on his Manhattan rooftop with his flatmate, dancer/choreographer Chris Jarosz. Watch this to feed on their alfresco freedom. Fairchild is an electric dancer and the juicy energy is both slack and taut, masculine and feminine, low slung and light-footed. It‚Äôs very cool and very now. Alvin Ailey‚Äôs most famous work, Revelations, gets a lockdown edit, splicing together the dancers performing a short excerpt at home. The settings couldn‚Äôt be more busily domestic: furniture and fridge magnets, indifferent flatmates and curious dogs. But, as the hum of the spiritual I Been Buked rises, the dancers arms stretch into a low V, faces upturned to the heavens, and they briefly transcend the everyday. Another clip, of Rennie Harris‚Äôs Lazarus, features funky house footwork for immediate uplift. If you know what to do with an .fbx file, this one‚Äôs for you. Choreographer Alexander Whitley was due to premiere his latest work, Overflow, last weekend, but he‚Äôs now musing on digital choreography instead. He‚Äôs released a series of motion capture improvisations and is sharing all the digital files so that anyone ‚Äì designers, composers, digital artists ‚Äì can create a response. Trippy visuals ahoy! –û–ß–ï–ù–¨ —Å–∫—É—á–∞–µ–º!!!

He enacts Giselle with his wife, the Bolshoi‚Äôs Maria Vinogradova, while she cooks lunch, Valeria Zapasnikova does Don Q with a dinner plate for a fan, and Ella Persson‚Äôs Cinderella, alas, really cannot go to the ball this time. @cesarcorrales926 quite literally making my head spin üòÇ A post shared by  Francesca Hayward (@frankiegoestohayward) on Apr 10, 2020 at 7:53am PDT The lockdown has put paid to one big date in the ballet diary, Francesca Hayward‚Äôs debut in Swan Lake, but she and partner Cesar Corrales are keeping their muscles warm. The videos are only a matter of seconds long but it‚Äôs worth it for the joy on Hayward‚Äôs face as Corrales spins her in dizzying multiple pirouettes, her smile getting wider with each turn. A treat to see dancers out of character, just loving dancing.
