As member of the Greater London council for Hampstead and vice-chair of its transport committee, Enid Wistrich did much in the late 1970s to save the North London line. British Rail and the Department of Transport wanted to close it, but the GLC gave BR a subsidy to keep it going, and eventually it was incorporated into the very successful London Overground network.
