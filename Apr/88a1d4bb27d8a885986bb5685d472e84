Your obituary of Bob Andy (30 March) reminded of me of a series of graffiti at Hull University in the early 1970s that inserted great thinkers into song titles. In this case: Jung, Gifted and Black. Others included Hegel Don’t Bother Me, and By Durkheim I Get to Phoenix.Jonathan FrenchYork • Peter Dickinson, in his fine obituary of the organist Jennifer Bate (30 March), surely understates when he says that her husband George Thalben-Ball, was “somewhat older”. Jennifer Bate was born in 1944, George Thalben-Ball in 1896.Roger MortimoreMadrid, Spain • As a “regular purchaser” of the Guardian for more than 50 years I can assure Keith Flett (Letters, 31 March) that I have never once grown a beard.
