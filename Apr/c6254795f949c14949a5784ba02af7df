The announcement of massive income increases for Zoom, Netflix, Amazon, Disney etc should make us wonder whether it is time to consider a windfall tax on companies who are doing so well out of the lockdown when others are going to the wall. It could fund the recovery universal income proposed by some MPs.John BullSouthstoke, Somerset • If Denmark can refuse to bail out those registered in tax havens, why is this not being considered in Britain? Richard Branson is surely a case in point (Branson to mortgage Caribbean island as he seeks Virgin bailout, 20 April).Liz StruttRottingdean, East Sussex • Stuart Jeffries’ article on primates (G2, 22 April) ends with a touching anecdote about a broken-nosed old Barbary macaque being comforted by warm hugs from some younger ones. I’m not a macaque, and my nose is fine, but I am a primate, and I do so long for hugs from my young relatives.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire • Thank you for V’s article about touch (G2, 21 April). I’m so lucky that I see my daughter every week, when she delivers our shopping. We stand and talk for a bit, in the drive, two metres apart and then she goes; I go into the house and cannot stop the tears because we could not hug each other.Vanessa ReburnLittle Cheverell, Wiltshire • I was touched that the obituary of Larry Tesler (28 February) had been written by (the late) Jack Schofield. It feels that an era of discovery in computing is passing.Rick OsmanBarnet, Hertfordshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
