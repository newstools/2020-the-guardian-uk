Lockdown has wreaked havoc on our social lives. Birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, funerals and christenings all feel a little smaller now, with most being relayed on video calls through screens. Coronavirus has separated us physically, but people are coming up with creative ways of ensuring that they can get together when it matters most. People are celebrating their birthdays virtually, marrying on Zoom, hosting isolation discos and one ingenious soul has even recreated Glastonbury festival in his back garden using Lego. We would like to photograph how you’re experiencing these events, while social distancing. If you are planning a special occasion in the next fortnight in the UK, we would like to hear from you. One of our photographers, Gideon Mendel, would like to be there – if possible, in person at a safe distance – to capture the moment. If you have big plans, let us know in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions. Our photographer may be in contact, so please do leave contact details.
