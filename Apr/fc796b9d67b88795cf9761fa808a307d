This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Guildhall Art Gallery, situated in London’s Square Mile. The collection is rich in Victorian art, ranging from the pre-Raphaelites to orientalism, classicism and narrative painting. The gallery’s collection of London paintings takes visitors on a colourful journey into the city’s past, covering everything from dramatic events such as the Great Fire of London to everyday street scenes.
