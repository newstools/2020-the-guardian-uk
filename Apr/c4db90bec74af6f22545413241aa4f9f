This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists. Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by Derby Museum and Art Gallery. Derby Museums runs three sites in Derby, including the Museum and Art Gallery, the Museum of Making at Derby Silk Mill, and Pickford’s House Museum. You can see art from Derby Museum and Art Gallery on Art UK here. Find out more about the Derby Museums here.
