I note that Dr Matheson, having difficulty volunteering to rejoin the NHS, writes from Dumfries (Letters, 10 April). The organisation in which I work, NHS Education for Scotland (NES), has responsibility for coordinating the recruitment of health professionals in Scotland. The homepage of the NES website has a link called Coronavirus (Covid-19) Recruitment. I hope this is of help to you, Dr Matheson, and, of course, many thanks for volunteering.Sarah GrahamLargs, North Ayrshire • Re Sue Smith’s letter (9 April) on funny Guardian women, yes please, more of Nancy Banks-Smith, Lucy Mangan and Grace Dent.
