Arsenal have spoken to David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pépé and Granit Xhaka after they were seen flouting government guidelines on physical distancing. David Luiz and Xhaka were seen meeting up in a park in north London, a video emerged of Pépé playing football with friends, and Lacazette was pictured standing too close to a man valeting his car on his drive. It is understood the club has spoken to all four players to remind them of their responsibilities. Several players have been caught flouting the government guidelines since the UK introduced a lockdown to help curb the spread of coronavirus. Jack Grealish was found to have attended a house party, Kyle Walker hosted a party of his own with two sex workers and Mason Mount was spotted playing five-a-side with Declan Rice. Arsenal’s north London rivals Tottenham have also been repeat offenders. Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko apologised this week after Aurier filmed the duo holding a joint fitness session in a park, about a fortnight after José Mourinho admitted he had behaved wrongly by taking Tanguy Ndombele for a one-on-one training session in a north London park.
