Tottenham’s all-time top scorer, Jimmy Greaves, is receiving treatment in hospital, the club have confirmed. Nobody has scored more top-flight goals in English football than the 80-year-old, who started his career at Chelsea before spells at Milan, Spurs and West Ham. Greaves, part of England’s triumphant 1966 World Cup squad, suffered a severe stroke in May 2015, since which he has used a wheelchair. In a statement late on Tuesday evening, Tottenham said: “We can confirm that our record goalscorer Jimmy Greaves is currently being treated in hospital. We are in touch with his family and will provide further updates in due course. “Everybody at the club sends their best wishes to Jimmy and his family.” We can confirm that our record goalscorer Jimmy Greaves is currently being treated in hospital.

In the latter he played in England’s three group games but was not recalled after an injury ruled him out of the quarter-final. At club level he won two FA Cups with Spurs and the European Cup Winner’s Cup, and his goals helped Milan win Serie A in 1961-62 though he had moved to White Hart Lane mid-season.
