Tottenham’s Son Heung-min has started his three-week mandatory national service in South Korea. Son is serving with the Marine Corps on the island of Jeju, where he will undergo basic training. The 27-year-old forward, who completed a two-week quarantine after his return to South Korea, is required by law to carry out national service by his 28th birthday. He was due to serve 21 months but earned an exemption after being part of the South Korea team who won the Asian Games in 2018 and has to complete only three weeks. Spurs and Son saw an opportunity for him to do that before the anticipated resumption of the Premier League season. He is expected to return to London in the middle of May. Son’s time with the marines is not a public relations exercise; he will be exposed to tear gas, go on lengthy hikes and be trained in how to fire guns.
